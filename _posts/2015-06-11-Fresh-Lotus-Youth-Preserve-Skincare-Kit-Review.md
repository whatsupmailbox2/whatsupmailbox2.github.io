<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I love sets because you end up getting more value than cost, and this one is a set that Fresh seems to always come out with and I'm thankful for that! The bag is great for traveling and has a lining inside that is easy to clean. The products come in decent sizes that you can definitely use and see if it's working for you or not. The main reason I buy this set is because of the moisturizer. If you have combination skin or even oily skin, this is a good moisturizer for both day or evening that will give you the needed moisture without the oil. I've been using this moisturizer for years now and haven't found anything better so far. Plus with this set you get extra products to try from Fresh and a cute bag to boot, so its a win for me.</p>
