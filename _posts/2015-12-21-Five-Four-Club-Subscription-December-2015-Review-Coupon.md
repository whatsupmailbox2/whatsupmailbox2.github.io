<p>When you subscribe, you'll take a profile survey to input your size and style preferences. My husband selected "Classic" as his style with a preference in vibrant rich colors. There are 4 options in style; Classic, Casual, Fashion Forward or a Mix of all.</p>

<H4>Based on my husband's "Classic" profile, here is what they sent:</H4>

<p>This sweater is made of 60% cotton and 40% polyester. It's a great light sweater for layering and the color is perfect for winter and the holidays. My husband loves it!</p>

<p>My favorite items to receive from <a href="https://www.fivefourclub.com/getstarted?referrer=RE731318" target="_blank">Five Four Club</a> are jackets and the next best thing are pants. So when I saw a pair of jeans in this month's shipment I was excited. This is the first jeans my husband has received from them and they're pretty great.</p> 

<p>The material is made of 81.6% cotton, 16.9% polyester, and 1.5% spandex. It's your typical jean thickness but is not stiff and has stretchability. My husband only wears jeans that has some stretch in them so this was a good match.</p>

<p>The pockets in the back are somewhat different as they have some stitching across the bottom. It's only for visual effects though as the pocket itself still has the depth going all the way to the bottom stitching.</p>

<p>These jeans will surely be used, both for casual and business casual (they're dark enough for that). It's a great basic jeans to have in your wardrobe.</p>

<H4>And here's a look at the items on my husband:</H4>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Another great month from Five Four Club! Typically my husband has a "Fashion Forward" style on his profile, but for this month he decided to switch it up to "Classic" for those holiday family events that we'll be attending this month. The items that were sent surely matched this style and are a great addition to his wardrobe.</p>

<p>If you haven't subscribed yet, you can <a href="https://www.fivefourclub.com/getstarted?referrer=RE731318" target="_blank">get your first package for only $30 through this link</a>, that's an amazing deal!</p>
