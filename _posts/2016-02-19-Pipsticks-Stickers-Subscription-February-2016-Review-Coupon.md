<p>So I've joined the whole planner addict community this year and in doing so, I've been really into decorating it with stickers and making it all pretty. There's nothing more encouraging than looking at your schedule with cute images and motivating pictures next to it! =)</p>

<p>Browsing online looking for a sticker subscription, I stumbled upon <a href="https://pipsticks.com/refer/Loret-REKAFKUO" target="_blank">Pipsticks</a> and decided to give them a try.</p>

<p><b>This review is for the Pro Club Classic package.</b></p>

<p><i>Note: The following package is actually January's pack. Pipsticks shipped their "January" packs on Jan 1st and Feb 15th and shipped out their Valentine's Day packs on Jan 15th and Feb 1st. This was done so that everyone was able to get their V-Day stickers in time to use them on V-Day. So if you subscribe after Feb 1st (which is what I did), you'll receive January's pack.</i></p>

<p>They send out their stickers in this see through plastic packaging and inside of it is a thick glassine envelope that contains all the sticker goodies. I love this packaging!</p>

<p>The back of the envelope is sealed with a "Stick 'Em Up" sticker.</p>

<p>They also send a postcard in every monthly package. The picture above also includes some stickers from the package. The outer space themed stickers are on clear velum and there's also 2 stamp-sized stickers of cats.</p>

<p>These stickers are great for my planner. I can even use some of them as gift labels!</p>

<p>Sheets of animal stickers! One sheet is fully dedicated to cats and since I own one, I can relate to the love people have for these wonderful creatures and will surely be using this.</p>

<p>More cat stickers in cute poses and a sheet of fruit stickers. I'll be using these for both my planner and for scrapbooking.</p>

<p>Flower stickers, more fruit stickers and then there's these funky ones in the middle that portray a jam jar and a fruit (I think) passed out with a few dogs laying over it. I might use the very last one on a day where I'm all pooped out!</p>

<p>Stickers in shapes are great for planners. Either to cover a mistake or to highlight a certain date in your calendar page. That is exactly what I'll be using them for.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> So there were A LOT of stickers in this pack. Some cute, some very useful and then some of them are just downright funky and funny. I enjoyed the diversity of it all and all of them were of great quality. The packaging itself is beautiful and very crafty which started my whole unboxing experience on a great note. For $14.95, I definitely received more than the cost in terms of stickers. If you're into scrapbooking, planner decoration or love decorating your items with stickers, try this subscription out and see if it fits your taste. Every month is a different theme and I can't wait to see what next month's package will have in store for me!</p>
