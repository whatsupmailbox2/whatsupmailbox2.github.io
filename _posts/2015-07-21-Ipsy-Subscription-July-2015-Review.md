<p>Ipsy always ships their bags in bright neon pink padded envelops. You can see them a mile away!</p>

<p>Ipsy is very similar to Birchbox where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependant on your preferences. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items.</p>

<p>This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.</p>

<p>Every month Ipsy sends their items in makeup bags that they produce exclusively, and lately the bags have been getting better and better both in quality and design. Keep it up Ipsy!</p>
<br>

<H4>And here are my items:</H4>

<p>July's theme is "Summer Lovin" and all the items look perfect for a day in St. Tropez ;)</p>
<br>

<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

<DT><a href="https://www.coolwayhair.com/ProductDetail.aspx?pid=131" target="_blank">Coolway Beachy Salt Spray</a></DT>
<DD>Travel size 15 ml, Value $2</DD>
</DL>

<p>Sea salt sprays are in trend for summer, I mean who doesn't want to have "just came back from the beach" hair look. But this way you don't even have to go to the beach if you don't have one nearby, minus the sun damage too.</p>
<p>This spray promises beachy curls that's both matte and non-sticky, and it's formulated with Dead Sea salts for additional mineral nourishment.</p>

<DD>Full Size, Value $4.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I can never have enough eyeshadows so I was happy to find this item in my bag, thanks Ipsy! The colors match my skin tone and is versatile where I can wear it lightly for daytime and heavy for night.</p>

<DT><a href="http://beabombshellcosmetics.com/product/lip-balm/ruby/" target="_blank">Be a Bombshell - Lip Balm in Ruby</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size, Value $14</DD>
</DL>

<p>Another item that I can never have enough of, lip balms!</p>

<p>The color I received is Ruby which is a bright true red, but the color goes on pretty sheer, so not too heavy -love it.</p>

<DT><a href="http://tartecosmetics.com/tarte-item-powder-bronzer" target="_blank">Tarte Amazonian Clay Waterproof Bronzer</a></DT>
<DD>Travel Size 3 g/.11 oz, Value $10</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm already a huge Tarte fan and I actually have this bronzer in full size, so I was more than happy to get a travel size version of this.</p>
<p>This bronzer does have a bit of sparkle for that glow, and I have combination skin so I typically shy away from anything that glitters, but this bronzer gives just the right amount of glow so rest assure it'll be fine even on oily/combination skin.</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.aveneusa.com/products/categories/cleansers/cleanance-gel-soapless-cleanser-1" target="_blank">Avene Cleanance Gel Soapless Cleanser</a></DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 25ml, Value $2.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>This cleanser is for oily or blemish-prone skin. I fall in that category so this was a match for me. I also appreciate that it's soap-free since my skin is also sensitive, and being soap-free makes it possible to cleanse without stripping the skin.</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy</a> did a great job again this month in matching the items to my profile. I absolutely loved every single item and will definitely be using them asap. The total value came up to $33.49 which is great for a $10 subscription. I think this might be my favorite bag so far from them!</p>
