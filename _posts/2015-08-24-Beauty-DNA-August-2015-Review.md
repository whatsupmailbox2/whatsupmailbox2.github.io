<br>

<p>This is my first box from Beauty DNA so I was super excited when I finally got it in the mail!</p>

<br>

<p>I purchased a deal from <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Ruelala</a> (it's no longer available) a couple of months back but only got around to redeeming it this month. Checkout my blog frequently as I post deals on subscription boxes whenever they're available =)</p>

<p>Beauty DNA is a completely different experience than other beauty subscriptions since everyone gets a different full-sized product that's matched with their skin concerns or needs. When you join, there's a "Beauty Profile" that you complete and below are just a couple of examples of the questions:</p>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNAAugust2015Profile.png'></center></p>
<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNAAugust2015Profile2.png'></center></p>

<p>These are 2 out of 14 pages that you'll need to complete and although that might seem like a lot, think of it as a consultation with your doctor - the more you let them know about you, the more they can help you out. It didn't take me long at all to complete it and I also like the fact that you can access your Beauty Profile anytime and modify it if you ever have any changes in your skincare needs.</p>

<H4>Based on my Beauty Profile, here is the item they matched me with:</H4>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNAAugust2015Toner.jpg'></center></p>

<DT><a href="http://www.equitance-us.com/equitance-skin-care-brightening-toning-lotion.html" target="_blank">Equitance Brightening Toning Lotion</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size 150 ml net 5.0 fl. oz, Value $50</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've never heard of this brand before, but I'm always up for a toner so that was a relief. To be honest, I was quite worried that they'd match me with something completely off of my profile due to experiences with other subscriptions, but I think this will work just fine.</p>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNAAugust2015Toner4.jpg'></center></p>
<p>The toner came sealed which is good to know if you're planning on getting this through a swap.<p>
<br>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNAAugust2015Info.jpg'></center></p>
<p>Beauty DNA also included a detailed Beauty Report about the product and why they matched it for you.</p>
<br>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNAAugust2015Info2.jpg'></center></p>
<p>It also includes the value of the product.</p>

<p>I love this Beauty Report, it feels so personalized and informational too!</p>
<br>

<H2><i class="icon-gift"></i> Bonus Item:</H2>

<p>Because I purchased this Beauty DNA subscription through <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Ruelala</a>, the deal also included one extra product with every box. So here's my extra product:</p>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNAAugust2015Cleanser.jpg'></center></p>

<DT><a href="http://www.drbrandtskincare.com/product/pores-no-more-cleanser-nettoyant.do" target="_blank">dr.Brandt Pores No More Cleanser</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size 3.5 fl oz / 105 ml, Value $35</DD>
</DL>

<p>OMG, I just got a sample of this cleanser from my August 2015 Birchbox (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Birchbox-Subscription-Box-August-2015-Review-Coupon/" target="_blank">read my review here</a>) and totally loved it so I was ecstatic when I saw I got a full-sized version of this in my Beauty DNA box. Thank you thank you thank you! I was already planning on buying it after finishing my sample, so this totally saved me $35, yay!</p>

<p>This bottle did not come sealed, but that aside, this cleanser works really well for oily/combination skin (a.k.a ME!). It has tea tree oil, willow bark and salicylic acid to decongest pores, neutralize sebum and keep blemishes at bay. It doesn't dry up your skin as other products like these do, and it really makes your face feel ultra clean! I love how clean my face feels after using this cleanser, feels like I used my Clarisonic, super clean. No joke, try it yourself and you'll see what I mean ;) Again, I'm so in love with this cleanser!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I'm in love with Beauty DNA! They did a great job at matching me with a product that I need and the value is totally there, especially with the extra item too! And if I had to be completely honest, I actually love the bonus item more than the matched item which makes this box an absolute slam dunk for me. If you're tired of sample sizes, try Beauty DNA and find new products that will work for you. I can't wait to see what they'll match me with next month!</p>
