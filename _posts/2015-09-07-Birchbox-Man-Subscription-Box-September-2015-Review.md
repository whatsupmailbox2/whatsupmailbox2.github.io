<p>This month's items are amazing!</p>
<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<DT><a href="http://lstnsound.co/products/cherry-earbuds" target="_blank">LSTN Bowery Earphones in Cherry Wood</a></DT>
<DD>Value $49.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>My husband chose this for his Sample Choice item. He already owns a LSTN headphones from the July <a href="https://bespokepost.com/r/5e44e4d3" target="_blank">Bespoke Post</a> box (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Bespoke-Post-Subscription-Box-July-2015-Vibes-Review-Coupon/" target="_blank">read my review here</a>), so he was so happy to get earphones that match as well.</p>

<img src="/images/BirchboxManSep2015Lstn2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="LSTN Bowery Earphones"/></a></center>

<p>Each pair of LSTN Bowerys is individually handcrafted from real wood, so each pair is different (the wood grain might vary). The sound quality is great (especially for this price point) and it also has a mic, great for hands-free calling. The cables are wrapped with nylon making it harder to get tangled which is much appreciated. I hate it when I have to spend hours (or at least it seems like hours) to untangle my earphones. It's a pain in the behind and I just give up in the end if it's really badly tangled.</p>

<p>And another great thing about these is that for every pair of headphones/earphones sold, LSTN helps restore hearing to a person in need by donating a portion of the proceeds to Starkey Hearing Foundation. So you get to make a difference as well, how awesome is that.</p>

<DT>Lab Series - MAX LS Age-less Power V Lifting Cream</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 10ml, Value $15.50 (Full Size 50ml, $78)</DD>
</DL>

<p>This cream is intended to be used at night and consists of a powerful formula for rapid cell repair that stops sagging and wrinkles in their tracks.</p>

<p>My husband is quite low maintenance when it comes to skincare, he mostly focuses on grooming products. But as I always say, prevention is always better than correction so he'll definitely try this (or at least try to remember using it at night).</p>

<DD>Travel Size 15 ml/0.51 fl.oz., Value $1.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>Travel sized face wash are always welcomed, you can always use them and this one especially is great for my husband since it's fragrance free. He can be a bit sensitive towards certain scents. And just in case women are reading this review, CW Beggs and Sons is the same company that produces the Marcelle skincare and makeup line for women (also available in the Birchbox shop).</p>

<DT><a href="http://arquiste.com/product/aleksandr/#history" target="_blank">Arquiste - Aleksandr Eau de Parfum</a></DT>
<DD>Sample Vial, Value $3? (Full Size 100ml $190)</DD>
</DL>

<p>What a coincidence, my husband's name is Alexander and he's Russian too! The history behind this perfume involves Alexander Pushkin in St. Petersburg, Russia. Initially the scent was a bit too strong for him, but after it mellowed down, he actually loves it. The main notes of the fragrance are: Neroli, Violet Leaf, Fir Balsam, and Russian Leather.</p>

<DD>Travel Size 1 fl.oz./30 ml., Value $2.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>This body wash is all-natural with essential oils of sandalwood, ginger, and cedar. The texture is like honey gel and it's made of only eight simple ingredients, and is completely free of parabens, SLS, petroleum, silicones and harsh, mysterious chemicals. And its gentle, low-sudsing formula is gentle on even sensitive skin. The full size is only $20 so we might be purchasing this once our sample is gone.</p>

<DD>Sample Packets 7ml, Value $1?</DD>
</DL>

<p>Hydrating shampoos are what we need in our house currently to repair what summer has done to our hair. This does just that and also moisturizes your scalp. Plus I love that all their products are Made in the USA!</p>

<DT>The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Promo Item</DT>
<DD>Value $5.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>Every subscriber received this item in their September 2015 box. It was inspired by the movie "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." and although I haven't seen the movie yet, I know it got great reviews and I'm clearing my schedule to see it this week!</p>

<br>

<p>This 11-in-1 multitool will definitely come in handy for when we go camping, and I think in general it's such a useful tool to have for any guy. The size is also travel friendly, smaller than a credit card.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> My husband absolutely LOVED this month's box. It had cool gadgets (earphones and 11-in-1 multitool) plus the skincare was a hit as well, such a great box! He was lucky enough to choose the earphones for his Sample Choice item and that alone has a value of $50! So it goes without saying how great this month's value was for us.</p>
