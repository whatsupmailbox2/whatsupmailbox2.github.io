<p>Sprezza Box is becoming one of the top boxes that my husband can't wait to receive. It's filled with quality products and their customer service is spectacular (I've experienced it myself due to receiving a flawed item). I was amazed by last month's box which included a beautiful Arvo watch (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Sprezza-Box-Subscription-July-2015-Review-Coupon/" target="_blank">you can read the July 2015 review here</a>)! So needless to say, it's always exciting opening up this box =)</p>
<br>

<DT>And here are the items:</DT>

<br>

<p>How awesome is this month's items, so perfectly blue and dapper!</p>

<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

<p><center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2015Tie2.jpg'></center></p>
<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.bullandmoose.com" target="_blank">Bull + Moose</a> Tie</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $39</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love it when boxes include a tie. My husband needs to expand his tie collection since he barely has any, so this was a great item to get!</p>
<p>The color and pattern is classic yet modern, so it will surely go with just about anything.</p>

<center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2015Tie.jpg'></center>
<p>The tie is hand made and 100% cotton.</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2015PocketSquare.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><a href="http://saltdapper.com/pocket-squares.html" target="_blank">Salt + Dapper Pocket Square</a></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $15</DD>
</DL>

<p>Pocket squares are great to add that extra pop in your outfit and it definitely completes the look in my opinion. The checkered pattern fits the tie quite well and as always Sprezza Box always color coordinates the items in the box to be used together. I love that about this box!</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2015Socks.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><a href="https://www.yo-sox.com/collections/mens-socks" target="_blank">Yo Sox! Socks</a></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $9.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>As my husband always say, you can never have enough socks! And unlike other sub boxes, Sprezza tends to send classy patterns compared to the crazy and sometimes whacky ones that others tend to send. The Navy blue paired with the herringbone pattern goes quite well together and will certainly make your feet look dapper.</p>

<p>Yo Sox! also has a "Sock of the month club" subscription where you can choose to get 1, 2 or 3 pairs of socks delivered to you monthly. You can <a href="https://www.yo-sox.com/collections/sock-of-the-month-club" target="_blank">read more about it here</a>.</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2015TieClip.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.weekendcasual.com/collections/tie-clips/products/silver-arrow-tie-clip-1-75" target="_blank">Weekend Casual SILVER ARROW Tie Clip</a></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $12 (Sprezza valued this at $10 but on their website it's actually $12!)</DD>
</DL>

<p>Another item that my husband has very little of, a tie clip, yay! And what a cool one to boot!</p>

<p>Sprezza suggests using this clip between the 3rd or 4th buttons to keep your necktie in place.</p>

<center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2015TieClip2.jpg'></center>
<p>The clip came packaged in a small zipped bag for extra protection.</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2015Soap.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><a href="http://drsquatch.com/collections/our-products/products/gold-moss-scrub" target="_blank">Dr. Squatch GOLD MOSS SCRUB Soap</a></DT>
<DD>1.2 oz Sample Bar, Value $1.44</DD>
</DL>

<p>This soap bar smells like a handsome strong rugged man if that makes sense. It's unique and masculine, I can't wait for my husband to use this! ;)</p>
<p>From Dr. Squatch: "One of our most revered scents, a truly unique bar scented with oak moss. This bar is a subtle earthy musk with a hint of freshly ground cocoa and added sea salt.  Very popular with woodsmen and urbanites alike."</p>
<p>There was also a coupon code to get free shipping with any order on the other side of this bar, which I will surely be using asap!</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I'm continuously happy with each and every box I've received so far and not one item disappoints! I love how everything is color coordinated which makes it easy for my husband to style himself. I also love the fact that they always have their values on point (no overpricing items here!) in fact they under valued an item this time around. To me that's the signs of a quality and reliable subscription box. I'm a loyal fan of Sprezza for sure!</p>
