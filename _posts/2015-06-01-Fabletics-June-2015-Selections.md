<p>I think the new outfits look great and they named each one of them after a city in California! That's my hood!</p>
<p>I literally wanted to get them all. Good thing my self control kicked in and I finally made my selection, but I have a feeling I might purchase another outfit once I receive mine #typical.</p> 
<p>I can't wait for it to arrive!</p>
