</a></center>
<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="https://bespokepost.com/r/5e44e4d3" target="_blank">Bespoke Post</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $45/monthly or $55/one-time purchases + Free shipping.</p>
<p><b>Coupon:</b> <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Purchase on Rue La La</a> to save some extra $$$! OR, you can use <a href="https://bespokepost.com/r/5e44e4d3" target="_blank">coupon code ALONE</a> to get 25% off your first box!</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> Each box is a limited-edition, themed collection of men's lifestyle gear from up-and-coming brands. It can range from tools, accessories, grooming, fashion and skincare. They have a collection of themed boxes that are available for you to choose, plus new boxes are released every month. You can skip any month if needed (must be done prior to the 5th of that month) and cancellation can be done by emailing them.</p>

<p>Here are the prices on <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Rue La La</a>:
<ul>
<li>1 month $44 (reg. $45)</li>
<li>3 months $109 (reg. $135)</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Validity: July 14 through September 14, 2015</i></p>

<p>As you can see from the prices above, the 3-months deal is much better and I suggest purchasing that instead of the 1-month if you want to try them out.</p>

<p>I'm subscribed to them and totally recommend them for that special guy in your life or even for yourself! Some boxes are unisex so both men or women can take advantage of this subscription box.</p>

<p>*Note: By purchasing on Ruelala, you will be enrolled in their monthly subscription plan after your period ends, so make sure to cancel prior if you don't plan on keeping the subscription. You can cancel by emailing them, no calls needed here.</p>
