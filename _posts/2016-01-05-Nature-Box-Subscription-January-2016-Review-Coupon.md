<p>I have more of a salty preference so I tend to go for their crackers and chips, but I sometimes I go and venture to the sweet side. The Pretzel is a favorite and a repeat in my order, while the other 2 are new items that they came out with so I just had to try them out!</p>

## Items in detail:

<DT>Kung Pao Pretzels</DT>
<DD>Net Wt. 4 oz</DD>
</DL>
<p>These are amazing hence why I like to reorder them from time to time. They have the Kung Pao flavor in a cruncy pretzel form that just goes really great with beer or even crushed and used as a topping on a salad. Who am I kidding, it goes great with anything and anytime, a definite clear favorite for both my husband and I!</p>

<DT>Spicy Sriracha Popcorn</DT>
<DD>Net Wt. 1.6 oz</DD>

<p>I'm a big Sriracha fan. I always have to have the large sized bottle in our pantry at all times, no joke. So when these Sriracha-flavored popcorn "popped" into their new items, it went straight into my order. In my opinion it's not spicy at all, has a slight sweetness to it (as Sriracha sauce does), it's an all around tasty and crunchy popcorn snack. Love it!</p>

<DT>Garlic Bread Cheese Crisps</DT>
<DD>Net Wt. 3.5 oz</DD>

<p>These crisps are just like the John Wm. Macy's cheese crisps but garlicky. Almost like a crispy garlic bread that's extra cheesy, it's sooo good. I tend to pair these crisps with wine and some olives. Just be sure to have some mints nearby to combat that garlic breath ;)</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I love Nature Box, I can always rely on them to deliver good and tasty snacks that are unique as well. I also love that all snacks are packaged in a resealable bag, so handy when travelling. They also frequently introduce new snacks and flavors so you'll never be out of options, and this applies to both sweet and salty snacks. Definitely try them out, especially with the <a href="http://fbuy.me/dksQC" target="_blank">50% off first box offer</a>, and taste for yourself!</p>
