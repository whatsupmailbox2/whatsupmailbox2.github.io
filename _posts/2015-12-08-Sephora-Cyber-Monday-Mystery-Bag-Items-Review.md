<p>Sephora had a Cyber Monday Mystery GWP recently (they had one last year too so it may be annually) and I'm a sucker for mystery bags so I made a purchase just so I could see what I would get. As I recalled, last year's Cyber Monday mystery gift was pretty amazing so I had high hopes.</p>

<br>

<H4>And here are the items inside my Sephora Cyber Monday Mystery Bag:</H4>

<p>As you can see, there's a lot of sample packets which I'm not a big fan of, they never have enough product to really make a difference and for me to decide if it works or not. But that's just me.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the samples I got:</p>

<p><b>List of the items:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Sephora The Mascara 2ml</li> 
<li>Sephora Eyeshadow in Curacao Punch 0.8 g</li>
<li>Sephora Pearl Mask 1 sheet</li>
<li>Fresh Rose Face Mask (sample packet)</li>
<li>Josie Maran Pure Argan Oil (sample packet)</li>
<li>Sephora Colorful Blush in Sweet on You! (sample sheet)</li>
<li>Origins GinZing Eye Cream (sample packet)</li>
<li>Yves Saint Laurent Touche Ã‰clat in 3 shades (sample packet)</li>
</ul>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> To be honest, I was quite disappointed with the items. To be really honest, I'm kinda pissed. But hey, it's a mystery bag and there are so many variations of what people got that it's kind of a lottery. I must say though that they were displaying pictures of Glamglow, Make Up Forever and Becca items to name a few, which by the way I got none of them, so it was kind of misleading (at least for me). Instead I received a bunch of sample packets and a Sephora eyeshadow, mascara and face mask, sigh. Needless to say, this GWP was a dud, I honestly won't be using anything at all from this bag, absolutely nothing!</p>
