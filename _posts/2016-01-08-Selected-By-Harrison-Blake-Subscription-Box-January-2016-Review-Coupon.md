<p>With every box that they send, they also include a business-card-like info card that details the items and prices.</p>

<br>

<H4>And here are the items for January 2016:</H4>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeJan2016Items.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="SELECTED by Harrison Blake January 2016 Items" /></center>

<p>It's a RED theme this month and it includes a watch too, how awesome!!!</p>

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeJan2016Watch.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" /></center>

<DL>
<DT>Rose Gold PU Leather Watch</DT>
<DD>Value $40</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm still amazed at the inclusion of the watch. It's made of PU leather which is a material made with a split leather backing covered with a layer of polyurethane (hence the term "PU leather") that is applied to the surface and then embossed.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the watch:</p>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeJan2016Watch2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" /></center>

<p>The design is simple and masculine with brown straps and a rose gold face watch. I can't wait for my husband to wear this!</p>

<p>Side note: Initially the watch came with a manufacturer defect on the straps, but Harrison Blake's awesome customer service sent out a new one the next day, such prompt and amazing service!</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeJan2016PocketSquare.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" /></center>

<DL>
<DT>Linen Cotton Pocket Square</DT>
<DD>Value $22</DD>
</DL>

<p>Pocket squares are a great finishing touch to your blazer/jacket. It makes any man look oh-so dapper and well put together. And it really doesn't take much effort too, just fold and insert into your pocket and voila, perfection.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeJan2016PocketSquare2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" /></center>
<figcaption>The branding on the pocket square</figcaption>

<br>

<p>The color is a medium-dark red that I think will brighten up any outfit without being too overly bright. Just enough to pop up your look. The classic herringbone design is small and compact making this a classic pocket square. This will be a great addition to my husband's collection!</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeJan2016Tie.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" /></center>

<DL>
<DT>Microfiber Necktie</DT>
<DD>Value $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>In line with the red colored theme, this necktie is also a medium-dark red with white polka dots. This would have been perfect for the recent holidays, but good thing the pattern is quite classic that it'll go great for any occasion as well.</p>

<figcaption>A closer look at the back of the necktie</figcaption>

<br>

<p>The necktie is well made and will surely be used for many years to come.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeJan2016Bracelet.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" /></center>

<DL>
<DT>Wood Beaded Bracelet</DT>
<DD>Value $15</DD>
</DL>

<p>This bracelet is beaded on a clear elastic material so it's stretchable to fit your wrist. It's very light in weight and the beads themselves are about a 1/4 inch in length, so not too bulky or big.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeJan2016Bracelet2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" /></center>
<figcaption>A closer look at the beads</figcaption>

<br>

<p>The beads have shades of brown with some wood markings on them. I think it has an urban/outdoor look that can go with your everyday attire, either by itself or layered. This will go great with the watch!</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeJan2016LapelPin.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" /></center>

<DL>
<DT>Multicolor Felt Lapel Pin</DT>
<DD>Value $15</DD>
</DL>

<p>I would describe this lapel as woodsy whimsical. The material is felt which is great when you want to add a different texture to your outfit.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the lapel pin:</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This box is great to subscribe to when you want to expand your accessories or step up your look and achieve that dapper style. Every box always comes in either a themed style or color. This way you don't have to think too much on how to wear each item, just wear it altogether for a well thought out look! No one will know that someone else did the styling for you ;) The total value of this box came up to $117. That's a great value for a $25 box and it included a watch too! Keep in mind that prices are their stated values and some of the items are exclusive to the box, but even so, it's still a great value for the price. If you (or your special man) is into accessorizing or would like to expand and perfect your dapper style, this would be a great subscription to try or even to gift!</p>
