<p><i class="icon-dropbox"></i> Their next box is "Oui Please Vol. 1.6 White Winter in the Alps" and it's set to start delivering at the end of December! That's coming up soon and I so can't wait!</p>

<p>The French Alps are the portions of the Alps mountain range that stand within France, located in the Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur regions. It's home to famous resorts towns Chamonix, St. Gervais, Albertville (1992 Olympic Winter Games), Grenoble (1968 Olympic Winter Games), and Annecy with its old city and lake.</p>

<p>I was travelling in France in November and got to see the Alps from the French side, then I travelled to Switzerland and Italy and got to see the alps from that side as well. It truly is majestic, stunning and absolutely beautiful. I'm already missing that picturesque view! So I'm curious to see what products will be included to reflect this theme, perhaps something warm and cozy?</p>

<p>Well guess no more as I have a few spoilers from them, and here they are:</p>
