<DD>Retail Value $28</DD>
</DL>

<p>This makeup bag was revealed as one of the items earlier so I knew I was getting this and it looks even better in person. This bag also opens up like a doctor's bag so you can fit more items inside. The design reminds me a bit of Sephora though (must be the black and white stripes) but it really is beautiful and chic.</p>

<p>A look inside the bag:</p>
<center><img src='/images/PopsugarJuly2015Bag2.jpg'></center>

<p>The inside is lined with plastic material so it's liquid friendly, and you can see how the bag actually opens up.</p>

<DD>Retail Value $19.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm super happy that Popsugar decided to include a portable toothbrush and an electric one too! I travel quite frequently so I can totally use this. Currently I use a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush, but it can be a bit heavy and bulky to travel. Now I don't need to and can use this instead, yay!</p>

<center><img src='/images/PopsugarJuly2015Toothbrush2.jpg'></center>

<p>They also included a battery so you can use this right away, plus an extra toothbrush head (one is already attached inside the cap) how thoughtful!</p>

<DD>Retail Value $28</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love card holders, it's so convenient and fits well in my small clutches versus my big fat wallet. I have one in brown that I use frequently, so this red color is a great addition.</p>

<p>The back of the card holder:</p>
<center><img src='/images/PopsugarJuly2015Sorial2.jpg'></center>
<p>The slots on the back is different where you'll get to insert more cards there versus the individual slots that's in front. They also included a coupon code for future purchases, yay.</p>

<DD>Retail Value $28</DD>
</DL>

<p>I use Supergoop for my suncare needs so I know they're a good brand and I was happy to see that they included a product from them. This spray is both a makeup setting spray and a sunscreen, how awesome is that. It definitely cuts my beauty regimen by one step less plus it'll be easy to reapply sunscreen without undoing your makeup, genius!</p>

<DD>25 ct, Value $5.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I have products for "Yes To" and have grown to like them due to their natural ingredients. Plus they're available at Target making it convenient if I need to grab some more on a last minute. These are great for refreshing your face when you're travelling or out on the beach, or late at night when you're too tired to wash your face.</p>

<p>These wipes are formulated with blueberry and apple extracts, and it'll cleanse, remove makeup and moisturize all in one!</p>

<DD>1 bar, Value $1.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>A protein bar that uses chickpeas instead of nuts, interesting. It's also vegan, non-GMO, and gluten free.</p>

<p>I rely on protein bars when I'm outdoors and being active, they are a quick and convenient way to boost my energy. I have no problem with nuts in my protein bar so it's not something that's a must for me, but I find this to be very helpful for those who are alergic to nuts, great idea.</p>

<DD>3 cards, Total Value $18.97</DD>
</DL>

<p>I was just about to buy some more greeting cards to add to my collection, so thanks Popsugar for reading my mind. These greeting cards are of high quality and the fact that they included 3, well that's awesome.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at all 3 cards:</p>
<center><img src='/images/PopsugarJuly2015Card1.jpg'></center>
<center><img src='/images/PopsugarJuly2015Card2.jpg'></center>

<p>This card is so unique, it's modern and colorful design adds to the 3 dimensional shape making it uber cool. This card would be great to give to someone who's in the art industry or perhaps architecture. It look pretty cool so hmmm, maybe I'll just frame it lol.</p>

<center><img src='/images/PopsugarJuly2015Card4.jpg'></center>
<p>The picture doesn't do the card justice, it's actually a lovely white material with sewing details that's all white and it reminds me of a wedding dress. So naturally this is a Wedding card and I don't have a lot of those so I'm glad to add this to my collection.</p>

<center><img src='/images/PopsugarJuly2015Card3.jpg'></center>
<p>This is a birthday card that's feminine and intended for a lady. I think this is my least favorite in design yet most useful as Birthday parties are more common for us to attend.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I always love getting my Popsugar boxes every month, it's such a treat. This month was focused more on items for travelling and since I do travel frequently, it was such a hit for me. It goes without saying that I'll definitely be using every single item, and the coupons too for that matter. The total value came up to $130.94, another amazing value for a $39.95 subscription. As of yet, there hasn't been any spoilers for next month (August), not even a theme spoiler too, so I'm totally itching for them to release one soon! Will they still stick to Summer themes or will they start with Fall? Either way I'll keep you posted!</p>
