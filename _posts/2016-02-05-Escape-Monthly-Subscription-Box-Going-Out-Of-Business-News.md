<p>I hate learning about subscription boxes that will be ending and no longer in operation. It's so sad because I want small business to grow and thrive, but on the other hand life happens and sometimes it just didn't work out.</p>

<p>I subscribed to Escape Monthly before but it wasn't really my type of items so I stopped and I think a lot of people did too because they ended up sending a lot of older products or repeats which frustrated subscribers. Hopefully it's a lesson learned and I'm pretty sure the subscription box business is a tough world to come out on top, but let's be positive subscribers and continue supporting the one's that we love!</p>
