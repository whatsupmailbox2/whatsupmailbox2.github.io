<p>I'm surprised this month's box wasn't pink in color or had hearts to celebrate Valentine's but it did have symbols surrounding beauty. Not quite sure about this design though, kind of a miss for me.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>ARROW</b> Boost Color Enhancing Lip Balm</DT>
<DD>Full Size, Value $14</DD>
</DL>

<p>ARROW is a new beauty line that Birchbox created for the busy and outgoing women. I chose this lip balm for my Birchbox Sample Choice since I wanted to try it out. It's moisturizing and the formula adjusts to your pH to enhance your natural lip color. I'm sure the results vary with everyone, but with my lips it created a darker pinkish reddish color. I'm glad I got to try this!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>FHI Brands</b> Daily Beauty for Wildlife™ Healing Argan Oil</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample 15ml., Value $3.50</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This came with an inner foil seal.</i></p>

<p>So I'm not a big fan on putting oil on my hair even though I do get frizzy from time to time, but I also get oily hair easily hence why I try to avoid oil based products on my hair. I've tried this though and it does what it's supposed to do, hydrates, de-frizzes, and create a healthy shine. It's also more lightweight than other argan oil hair products, so maybe I can actually use this.</p>

<img src="/images/BirchboxFeb2016SahajanRestorativeEyeCream.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Sahajan</b> Restorative Eye Cream</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample 8ml (more than Half of Full Size 15ml), Value $24</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This tube did not come sealed.</i></p>

<p>"This Ayurvedic (a type of complementary and alternative medicine that originated in India) cream utilizes coconut oil to hydrate, honey to repair delicate skin, and triphala (a powerful antioxidant blend of three fruits) to brighten skin’s appearance and hide fine lines. The powerful blend is topped off with neem oil to reduce inflammation and signs of tiredness".</p>

<p>I always welcome eye products so this was a good match for me. I'm constantly staring into the computer for my work as well as working late nights, so a good eye cream to undo the damage is of course most welcomed. It does have a bit of a distinct and unique smell, kind of herbal or medicine scent, which might be off putting for some people, but it goes away quickly. It didn't bother me at all. I've only used it once so I can't really tell if it works or not, but thankfully the size of this sample is really generous so I'll certainly have enough product to see benefits.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>The Body Shop</b> Fuji Green Tea Body Butter</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 50ml, Value $5.25</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This did not come sealed.</i></p>

<p>"Featuring revitalizing green tea from Japan and Fair Trade shea butter from Ghana, this rich body butter hydrates skin for up to 24 hours, leaving it softer, smoother, and healthier."</p>

<p>This body butter smells great and it feels creamy and smooth too on my skin. I used it on my elbows which has been getting quite dry lately and my skin just soaked it up and it did hydrate the area so I'm pleased.</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Whish</b> Revitalizing Cleansing Oil</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 15ml, Value $4.50</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This did not come sealed.</i></p>

<p>"This skin-balancing cleanser uses a rich combination of olive fruit oil, organic rose hip oil, and organic coconut oil to do just that. It magically melts away makeup, grease, and impurities to leave behind a soft yet incredibly clean face."</p>

<p>Although there's a big following and rave on cleansing oils, I'm not one to benefit from it as I have sensitive and oily skin by itself. So sadly this will be gifted.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> There were some great products but also some misses for me in this box. The eye cream that I received was in a quite generous size, more than half the full size, and was worth $24. Plus I especially loved the ARROW (a Birchbox beauty line) lip balm which was full size and worth $14 in itself. Overall I did find use for everything except one product and the value to me is still way above what I paid for so it's still a win for me. With a total value of $51.25 for a $10 box, what's not to love!</p>
