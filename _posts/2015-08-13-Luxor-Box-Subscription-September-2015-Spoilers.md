# First Spoiler for Luxor Box!

<p>I love jewelry and it seems that Luxor Box has been including a jewelry piece with every box so far. Their first box included an earring, the second box had a necklace and now a bracelet, yay!</p>

<p>I love that it's gold since I wear that most often, so I'm thankful for that. I also hope this bracelet fits me or can be adjusted somewhat since I have petite wrists.</p>

<p>Valued at $268, this is the highest item Luxor Box has included so far. I love the simple design and it's also been seen on quite a few celebrities, so I'm excited I'll be adding this to my bracelet collection!</p>
