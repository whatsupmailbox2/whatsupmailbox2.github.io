<p>There's no additional info they've provided so far, and I'm curious to know if they'll release any spoilers at all.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">Popsugar Must Have QVC box</a> will be available for purchase only through QVC and <a href="www.qvc.com">QVC.com</a> starting on May 29th.</p> 

<p>From past experiences, special edition boxes by <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">Popsugar</a> always sells fast, so if you're interested, be ready to purchase that day!</p>
