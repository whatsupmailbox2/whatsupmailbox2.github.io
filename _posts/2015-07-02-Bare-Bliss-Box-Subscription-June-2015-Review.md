<p>The info card detailing items inside and prices.</p> 
<p>For some reason the info card is a bit blurry and hard to read. The font is quite small, but I think it may either be the printing or the image source not being good enough. Just something I noticed as I'm squinting my eyes to read it.</p>
<br>

<H4>And here are the items:</H4>

<DD>Full Size 15ml/.5 fl.oz., $12</DD>
</DL>
<p>I'm not sure why but the color Bliss on their website is completely off to what I received. The one I have is a light pastel pink color, while the Bliss color in their shop is purple. So strange. Are my eyes getting old?</p>
<p>Lillian Eve is a 5-free vegan & toxin-free nail polish that's made in the USA. This nail polish goes on opaque with a glossy finish. It does easily chip though so I would recommend a top coat.</p>

<DD>Small Jar 2 oz, $5.50</DD>
</DL>
<p>I've never tried cleansers that are in grain form before, but after researching a little about it, it seems like it can be healthier and safer.</p>
<p><blockquote>When liquid is introduced to skin care products, they can easily grow mold and bacteria. Therefore, commercial products contain a wide spectrum of preservatives to give them a longer shelf life. By giving you these ingredients in the dry form, it allows for you to have a completely natural cleanser, perfect for oily and acne-prone skin.</blockquote></p>
<p>The way to use this is by taking a small amount of the cleanser grains then add a few drops of water (or liquid of your choice) and massage onto wet skin. Instead of water, you can even use coconut water or olive oil, I just might try that!</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.organicaah.com/cart/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=50">Organic Aah - Argan Oil</a></DT>
<DD>Sample Size .3 oz?, Value $4?</DD>
</DL>
<p>I estimated the size and value due to lack of information. Although beneficial, I'm not that big into Argan oil. I'll use it on my hair, but that's about it. The bottle has no branding on it, probably because it's sample sized, but I would have appreciated some type of label on the actual bottle so I don't get confused as to what's inside when it gets lost in my skincare stash.</p>

<DD>1 sheet, $6.50</DD>
</DL>
<p>I hope the trend of temporary tattoos in subscription boxes is not coming back because I have a bunch already from the past and I haven't even used them yet. I'm quite disappointed that they included this item when it's supposed to be a natural and organic box, not sure how this fits in.</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> To be honest, I'm quite disappointed in this box, I think its the least favorite one I've received from them and I'm glad that my 6-month subscription has ended. The total value added up to $28 but I think the value of the tattoo is less for me personally plus the argan oil was an estimate so it might be off. I don't think the value is there for me and lately neither have the products. Although I like the theme of their subscription - natural and organic products - I think they need to step up their game in the variety and value area in order to get me to subscribe again.</p>
