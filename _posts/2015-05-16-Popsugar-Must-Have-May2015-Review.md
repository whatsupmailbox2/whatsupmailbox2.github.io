![Popsugar Must Have May 2015 Open Box](/images/PopsugarMay2015OpenBox.jpg)
This month their theme was "Colorful . California Sun . Glowing Skin . Fresh Flowers".
<br>
<br>

![Popsugar Box May 2015 Card](/images/PopsugarMay2015Card.jpg)
<p>They always include a fold out card that details all the items and prices. I typically read it towards the end of my unboxing, this way I don't get any spoilers and can ooohh and aaahh first, then read about them later -but that's just silly old me.</p>
<br>

![Popsugar Box May 2015 Kitsch Necklace](/images/PopsugarMay2015KitschNecklace.jpg)
<a href="http://www.mykitsch.com/trid-true-y-shaped-necklace/">Kitsch Tri'd & True Y-Shaped Necklace</a>, $32

<p>This was an item they revealed prior but it seemed so long ago that I forgot all about it. But sadly, my necklace arrived broken. It looks fine from the front, but behind the display where the necklace actually gathers, it broke hence unwearable. I reached out to their customer service (email is their only method) and we'll see what they have to say about it.</p>

<p>It does make me believe that the necklace itself is such a delicate piece and I'm not sure about the quality if it can break so easily. It's also long, 36 inches long. Plus I'm more of a gold person so this necklace failed to impress me.</p>

![Popsugar Box May 2015 Middle Kingdom Vase](/images/PopsugarMay2015MiddleKingdomVase.jpg)
<a href="http://www.mkporcelain.com">Middle Kingdom</a> Mini Plum Vase in Coral Red, $20
<p>Omg, this vase is so cute, I love it! It's a little bit smaller than my iPhone 6 Plus, which makes it perfect to display a single stem of flower. And the color is poppin red, which will brighten up any room.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mkporcelain.com">Middle Kingdom</a> is all about reviving Chinese porcelain traditions for a modern audience, and I can definitely see it being represented well in this vase. I looked at where I can buy some more (they don't sell it on their website) and there's a trend of it being sold in Art Museums, that's definitely a good sign.</p>

![Popsugar Box May 2015 SistersOfLosAngeles Towel2](/images/PopsugarMay2015SistersOfLosAngelesTowel2.jpg)
<a href="http://www.sistersoflosangeles.com">Sisters of Los Angeles</a> Beach Towel in Surf Sand Love design, $40
<p>This beach towel design was made exclusively for <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">Popsugar Must Have</a> so you won't be able to buy this towel on their website, but you can buy a mug or a tote in the same exact pattern.</p>

<p>This towel is big! I love everything about it. It's soft and I'm in California so the design is perfect for me. Hands down my favorite item of the box! I wish they included some coupon though so I can buy additional items (they typically do), but oh well, I just might buy the tote to add to my collection anyway.</p>

![Popsugar Box May 2015 Batiste SageRow](/images/PopsugarMay2015BatisteSage.jpg)
<a href="http://www.batistehair.com/fragrance-cherry.aspx">Batiste Dry Shampoo in Cherry Fragrance</a> - 50ml (deluxe sample size, 1/4 of the full size), $4
<p>I have tons of dry shampoo and I like to keep it that way due to my oily hair, so I'm happy to add another one to my stash. I've had <a href="http://www.batistehair.com/fragrance-original.aspx">Batiste Dry Shampoos</a> before and their great. I've never had the Cherry fragrance though and it truly does smell like bunches of cherries. At first I wasn't too sure about the smell, but it's starting to grow on me.</p>

<a href="http://www.sageandrow.com/products/bare-shave-cream">Sage & Row Bare Shave Cream</a> - FULL SIZE, $17
<p>I don't really have a need for shaving creams since my asian heritage has blessed me with the lack of hair in certain areas. But I do see that they are made with natural and organic ingredients such as shea butter, aloe, lavender and some essential oils. And the tube itself looks quite classy so it'll be great to insert into a spa themed gift, which is exactly what I'll be doing.</p>

![Popsugar Box May 2015 Hammonds Candies Taffy](/images/PopsugarMay2015HammondsCandiesTaffy.jpg)
<a href="http://www.hammondscandies.com/candy-types/mccraws-flat-taffy/mccraws-taffy-assorted-flavors">Hammond's Candies McCraw's Flat Taffy</a> $1
<p>Okay, so I'm not really into taffy and this just seems out of place to include in a <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">Popsugar Must Have</a> box. I'm passing this along to my husband who will eat anything sweet.
<br>

<p><b>My Thoughts:</b> I think this box represented the theme they had and I'm in love with 2 of the big ticket items so I'm happy with that. The total value of this box came up to $114 and although it's not my favorite box from them, I'll still use most of the items so I got my money's worth. I'm excited for the June 2015 box though since they released a <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/popsugar/Popsugar-June2015-Spoiler/">spoiler item</a> just a few days ago and that item alone is worth more than the subscription! Hint, it's perfect for sunny summer days. Check out my <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/popsugar/Popsugar-June2015-Spoiler/">Popsugar Spoiler news</a> I posted to see what it is. Here's hoping to a better box in June!</p>
