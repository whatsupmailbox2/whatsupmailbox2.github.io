<p>Using the results of the Palate Profile quiz that you complete upon joining, Club W works off your personal preferences to recommend stellar wines youâ€™ll love.</p>

<p>They also work directly with winemakers and vineyards, so they're able to deliver exceptional wines that are exclusive and you won't be able to find them anywhere else.</p>

<p>Plus, each box comes with a card that includes information about the grape, winemaker and vineyard, as well as tasting notes, pairing suggestions and a customized recipe. The info card is absolutely helpful!</p>

<p>What I also love about them is that they have a mobile app as well so you can view all the current available wines and you can also watch short videos of sommeliers tasting that wine, describing the palate and suggesting food pairing, it's such a cool app!</p>
