<DD>Value $22</DD>
</DL>

<p>My husband can never have enough socks so it's always a happy day when they come in my subscription boxes. The design is simple yet the bright magenta color makes it pop out with any outfit.</p>

<br>

<DT><b>My Suited Life</b> Silver Tie Bar</DT>
<DD>Value $15</DD>
</DL>

<p>A classic tie bar is a must in any gentleman's wardrobe and this is just that. It's simple, classic and will perfectly fit with any tie.</p>

<DT><b>My Suited Life</b> Midnight Sleek Tie</DT>
<DD>Value $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>These square end ties are so chic and modern, my husband has been wearing more of these styles lately and they just look so dapper. This tie is a modern version of your classic black tie and it will surely make you look like you're up to date with style. Plus the included tie bar looks great together with this tie, very well paired!</p>

<p>Oooh, a leather lapel! Made of 100% leather, this will surely make you look so fashionably distinct and uber cool. Love it!</p>

<br>

<p>Here's a look at the back of the lapel:</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Dude Wipes</b></DT>
<DD>2 singles packs</DD>
</DL>

<p>There's no value that <a href="https://gentlemansbox.com">Gentleman's Box</a> stated for these so I'm guessing it's either a bonus item or sponsored. Just for comparison, a box of 30 single-packs cost $8.79 on Amazon.</p>

<p>These disposable and flushable wipes were made by four guys who shared an apartment in Chicago after college. They wanted to make wipes specifically for the adult male market due to their lack of satisfaction with using baby wipes. So they embarked in a journey of research and design and launched their product in 2012.</p>

<p>I love their "let it rip" statement on the packaging. It's funny and... well... quite direct. As a woman myself, I have to use wipes in combination with toilet paper to feel extra clean. These are specifically made for men and personally I think it's well made, so I will surely be buying the bigger package for my husband!</p>

<br>

<p>These wipes are infused with vitamin E and aloe, is alcohol free and also quick drying. They can also be used for your face, hands, pits and dude region. And to top all of that off, 10% of proceeds will be donated to The Colon Club Charity.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Another great dapper curation from Gentleman's Box! Every item compliments each other and looks fashionably modern and chic. I can't wait for my husband to wear all the items just like they suggested in their info booklet. With a total value of $92, this is definitely one box a gentleman should have to join the dapper club!</p>
