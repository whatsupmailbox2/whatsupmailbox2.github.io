<p>I absolutely adore this subscription box and it's definitely my top favorite subs that I have. Plus it's so luxurious and French, very unique in the field of sub boxes and I totally recommend them if you're obsessed with French items like I am! #truestory</p>

<p><i class="icon-dropbox"></i> Their next box is "1.5 Along The Loire Valley" and boxes will start shipping out at the end of September and continue through the 1st week of October. I always get excited when my Oui Please box is coming soon, like SO EXCITED!!!</p>

<p>The Loire Valley (French: Vallée de Loire, pronounced: va le də lwa), spanning 170 miles, is located in the middle stretch of the Loire River in central France. It's referred to as the Cradle of the French and the Garden of France due to the abundance of vineyards, fruit orchards (such as cherries), and artichoke and asparagus fields, which line the banks of the river. It's also notable for its historic towns, architecture and wines. In 2000, UNESCO added the central part of the Loire River valley to its list of World Heritage Sites.</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> I get <a href="http://ouipleasebox.com" target="_blank">Oui Please</a> withdrawals during the off months that they don't ship, and when the time comes I get super super excited and can't wait for it to arrive to my doorstep! I literally stalk the shipping info and my mailman, no joke. Volume 1.5 looks heavenly and perfect for fall, I can't wait to see what items I get. Stay tuned for my review coming up later this month!</p>
