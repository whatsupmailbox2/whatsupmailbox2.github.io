<p>They included a candy cane in this month's box. The size was pretty small, but still appreciated!</p>

<p>On the back of the info card there's a message from them to snap a picture of your mani and share it on instagram.</p>

<figcaption>Color: Bird Fling</figcaption>
<br>

<p><b>Bird Fling</b> is a hot and bright red color with a "high gloss creme" finish. A great staple to have in your nail polish collection.</p>

<figcaption>Color: Olympiad 2018</figcaption>

<br>

<p><b>Olympiad 2018</b> is a light gold color with a "foil" finish. I think this color will go great for the holidays. Gold nails are a perfect accessory to a little black dress ;)</p>

<br>

<figcaption>Color: Baby, Baby, Baby 2010</figcaption>

<br>

<p><b>Baby, Baby, Baby 2010</b> is a purple metallic color with a "micro shimmer" finish. I'm not too sure if I'm in love with this color yet (still deciding), but it does look cool, just not as great on my olive skin tone. I tend to avoid anything in the purple color family. So, although it's a unique color to receive, I think I'll be gifting this to someone who will appreciate it more (and look better with it too!).</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I love the shape of the bottles of Square Hue, it's simple but quite aesthetically pleasing. The colors are unique since you won't be able to buy them on their website because it's limited-edition, and I like how they included different finishes for each nail polish that I received this month. Not sure if they do that everytime. Application was smooth and it did last quite awhile. What I also love about Square Hue is that they automatically donate a portion of each monthly subscription to an organization that is dedicated to helping others. Currently their donations go to <a href="http://www.a21.org" target="_blank">The A21 Campaign</a>, an organization with a mission to end human trafficking. I absolutely admire what Square Hue is doing. Not only are their nail polishes 7-free, cruelty-free, vegan-friendly and proudly made in the USA, but they are also contributing to a greater good in the world. I think Square Hue is a great subscription to have if you're a nail polish addict who is also health conscious and would like to contribute to a greater cause. Plus it makes a great gift as well =)</p>
