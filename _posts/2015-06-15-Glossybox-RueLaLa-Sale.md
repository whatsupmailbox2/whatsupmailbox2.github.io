<p><b>Subscription:</b><a href="https://www.glossybox.com/referal?CI=MTMzODY3" target="_blank"> Glossybox</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $21 / month + Free Shipping in the US</p>
<p><b>Coupon:</b> <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Purchase on Rue La La</a> and get the box for only $15!</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> Receive a selection of five beauty products that include niche, high-end, and emerging brands, housed in reusable keepsake boxes.</p>

<p>This is a good deal to try out Glossybox and see if it's right for you. I'd suggest trying the 1-month deal since the savings is more compared to the 6-month deal.</p>

<p>Here are the prices on <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Rue La La</a>:
<ul>
<li>1 month $15 (reg. $21)</li>
<li>6 months $95 (reg. 126)</li>
</ul>

<p>*Note: You will be enrolled in their monthly subscription plan afterwards, so make sure to cancel prior if you don't plan on keeping the subscription. You must cancel by the 14th of the month prior and this can be done directly through your online account.</p>

<p>If you haven't heard of Rue La La, its a website that has boutique sales and frequently also deals on subscription boxes.

I totally recommend them!</p>
