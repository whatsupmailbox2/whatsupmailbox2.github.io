<p>With Hatchery, you can experience flavors you never would have discovered on your own. The monthly subscription service sources small-batch ingredients and condiments from independent makers across the country and delivers them to your door, introducing you to the best new products on the market. Dedicated to individuals over companies, the staff travels to green markets, family farms and more in search of the most passionate producers. They then put their favorite finds into monthly tasting boxes, packaging them with recipes and bios of each maker.</p>

<p>Overflowing with everything from spreads, jams and honeys to syrups, cooking sauces and oils, boxes include just what you need to stock a unique pantry. Look forward to such products as blackberry extract from Meso Nutso, apricot ale beer jelly from Potlicker Kitchen and five-pepper sea salt from Mrs. Belem Trading Co. If you use up your supply before your next delivery, simply head to Hatchery’s online marketplace and pick up another. You never know what else you’ll find.</p>
