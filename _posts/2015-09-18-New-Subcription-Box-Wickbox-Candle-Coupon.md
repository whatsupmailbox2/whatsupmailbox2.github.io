<p>I LOVE LOVE LOVE candles. My husband thinks I have a hidden candle store somewhere in the house since I manage to have one appear here and there all the time, lol.</p>

<p>So naturally I was super excited to hear about this subscription box especially since it's luxury candles, oh la la... oui oui s'il vous pla√Æt!</p>

<p>How gorgeous is that box! Loving the color combination (pink and black happens to be my all time favorite colors!) and the dust cover for the candle, how awesome is that.</p>

<p>I've subscribed to candle boxes before, but none of them have met my high expectations and taste for that matter. <a href="www.wickbox.co" target="_blank">Wickbox</a> looks promising especially since they partner with brands that focus on both esthetics (think beautifully designed containers) and quality materials such as lead-free wicks and natural wax (soy, coconut or vegetable).</p>

<p>So it was a no brainer for me to instantly fall in love with this subscription and if you're like me - a candle addict - then I totally recommend for you to <a href="www.wickbox.co" target="_blank">check them out and subscribe</a>. They're first launch box will be shipping on October 15th!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for my review next month of their launch box!  xoxo, Loretta</p>
