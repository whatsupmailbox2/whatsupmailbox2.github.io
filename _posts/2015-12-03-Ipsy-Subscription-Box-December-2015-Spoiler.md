<p>A bright red bag design is coming this month, of course! It goes with the holiday/Christmas theme, I actually like it.</p>

<p>A natural lipstick from Pacifica may be in your <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy Glam Bag</a> this month! My profile has a preference for lipsticks so I'm hoping I get this (fingers crossed).</p>

<p>Those are the spoilers so far, but I'm already excited and wish my bag would just be here already!</p>
