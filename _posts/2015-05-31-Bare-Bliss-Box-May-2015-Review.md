<DT><a href="http://www.biorepublic.com/products/cucumber-sheet-mask">Bio Republic - Cucumber Breeze Soothing Sheet Mask</a></DT>
<DD>1 mask, $4.99</DD>
<blockquote>
** An ultra-soothing facial mask infused with natural cucumber extract, plant collagen, and vitamin e:

1. Soothes stressed skin and improves complexion.
2. Tightens pores and reduces appearance of fine lines.
3. For calm, rejuvenated, spring-fresh skin.
</blockquote>
<p>I like how this mask is biodegradable, made without Parabens, Sulfates, Pthalates, and Triclosan, and no animal testing.</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.ellovi.com">Ellovi</a> - Tinted Lip Butter</DT>
<DD>Full Size .15 oz, $5</DD>
<p>I always love getting lip products in my subscriptions so I was happy to see this and tried it on immediately. You can definitely smell the shea butter which I love, and it was instantly moisturizing and gave a very pretty soft hint of red to your lips.</p>
<p>The color is made by infusing a Mediterranean flower called Alkanet and it's also a "lead-free color so pure that you can eat it"!</p>
<p>The oval shape is also convenient for your pocket and applies better versus a round shape (at least for me). I'm finding more and more lip products come in this oval shape now. I love this so much that I will be getting their original version as well!</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.goddessgarden.com">Goddess Garden Organics</a> - Sunny Body Natural Sunscreen</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 1 oz./29.6 ml, $4.40</DD>
<blockquote>Made with plant-based ingredients and natural minerals. With its sheer, non-greasy application, this certified organic, reef safe, and biodegradable sunscreen is good for you and the world around you.</blockquote>
<p>I've seen this brand in Whole Foods and was also recommended to use it by my aesthetician due to it's natural and safe ingredients. I'm happy that I will finally be trying this and just in time for summer too!</p>
<p>Side note, from their website I see that they've changed their whole product packaging and it's completely different than the one I have. So I immediately checked to see if this was coming from an old stock, and based on the stated expiration date it's good till January 2017.</p>

<DT><a href="https://www.alaffia.com/store/pc/Neem-Shea-Butter-Skin-Recovery-Face-Cream-10p121.htm">Alaffia - Neem & Shea Butter Skin Recovery Face Cream</a></DT>
<DD>2 sample packets, $1 each?</DD>
<p>I'm always disappointed when I see foil packets in a subscription box, especially when it's counted as one of the items and not a bonus item. At least they included 2 packets, so I can try it more than once to see the benefits of it.</p>
<p>I do like that it's for problem or acne prone skin, and since I have oily/combination skin, this is right up my alley. This cream is recommended to be used when your skin is in need of intensive moisturizing treatment. Neem leaf extracts and kpangnan butter are ingredients in this product and will add toning and antioxidant properties to restore your skin's natural luminosity.</p>

<DT><a href="http://rockislandsponge.com/index.php?route=common/home">Rock Island Sponge Company</a> - Sea Sponge</DT>
<DD>1 sponge, $1.99?</DD>
<p>This sponge is tiny but will be perfect for face use. From the Bare Bliss Box info sheet, it says that this sponge becomes soft as silk when wet and will gently exfoliate your skin.</p>
<p>There's no documentation or tag that came with it, so I'm not sure what size or type of sponge it is since their website has multiple types. From Caribbean sea sponge, Mediterannean, South Pacific and many more. If I had to guess, it's probably the Caribbean Silk Sponge based on how it looks and the shape, so I based my pricing on that.</p>

<p><b>VERDICT:</b> I can't say if I loved this box or not, it did have some great products, I guess I'm just still disappointed in the foil packet items. The total value came up to $18.38 which is slightly below the cost of the subscription. I've had better boxes from them before and lately their curation hasn't been very great. I purchased a 6-month subscription and still have 2 months left, but I might cancel after if it continues to be below cost. Hopefully their June box will be better.</p>
