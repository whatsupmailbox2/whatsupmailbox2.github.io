<DT><a href='http://www.dogeared.com/daughter-sideways-heart-necklace%2C-gold-dipped/MRGG100310499.html#start=14&q=heart&sz=12'>Dogeared - Gold Bridal Necklace</a></DT>
<DD>16" chain, Retail Value $54</DD>
<p>This necklace is delicate, simple and gorgeous. Birchbox has this valued at $64, but I actually found the same exact necklace on Dogeared's website for $54, they call it the "Daughter sideways heart" necklace.</p>
<p>I love Dogeared jewelries and pretty much bought this box for this necklace alone! Confession, I'm already married and won't be in a bridal party anytime soon, but this box was just too good to pass #itsanaddiction</p>

<DT><a href='https://www.birchbox.com/shop/greenleaf-candle-tin/'>Greenleaf Candle Tin – Cashmere Kiss</a></DT>
<DD>Travel size 6 oz. / 170 g, Retail Value $10</DD>
<p>As picky as I am with fragrance, this candle smells romantic, feminine and showered with florals. Just like a wedding, what a perfect item to include!</p>
<p>Although not stated on their packaging, this candle is made from a soy and vegetable wax blend for a longer, cleaner burn. I've had candles from them before thanks to Birchbox, and this is a great addition for my summer candle indulgences.</p>

<DT><a href='https://www.birchbox.com/shop/jelly-pong-pong-glow-getter/'>Jelly Pong Pong - GLOW GETTER Highlighter</a></DT>
<DD>Sample Size 4 ml / 0.14 fl.oz., Retail Value $12.75</DD>
<p>I think it's a crime not to contour and highlight when wearing makeup. Including this item in the box fits the theme as it's definitely a must especially for a wedding and photo ops.</p>
<p>I have so many highlighters and am happy to add another one to my collection, but sadly I won't be using this due to parabens in their ingredients. Such a shame since I would have loved to try it, I guess I'll be gifting this to anyone who wants it.</p>

<DT><a href='https://www.birchbox.com/shop/jane-iredale-just-kissed-lip-and-cheek-stain/'>Jane Iredale Just Kissed Lip and Cheek Stain in Forever Pink</a></DT>
<DD>Sample size, Retail Value $3?</DD>
<p>This sample tube is tiny! I actually have one already thanks to Birchbox, and having another one is great since the size is so small.</p>
<p>Jane Iredale is a makeup line that's healthy for your skin with ingredients that are safe for your skin. I've been using their mineral powder and foundation for years and love it.</p>

<DT><a href='http://www.maydesigns.com'>May Designs</a> - Custom Bridesmaid Card</DT>
<DD>1 card with envelope, Retail Value $2</DD>
<p>This design is exclusive to Birchbox. It's simple, white with a tiny hint of pink color and a message that's clever and touching at the same time.</p>
<p>Since I bought this box without the intention of having a wedding, I'll keep this in my greeting card collection and hopefully can give it to a friend who can make use of this.</p>

<p><b>VERDICT:</b> Since I bought this box for the sole purpose of obtaining the necklace, I'm satisfied and thought it was money well spent (especially since I used one of those coupons above!). It was curated perfectly, although they probably should have chosen a different brand for the highlighter that is more health conscious. Birchbox markets this box as having a value of $92. From researching online, my total value came up to $81.75. The difference is due to the necklace's pricing, but everything else is pretty spot on. If you're getting married or will be in a wedding sometime soon, I highly suggest this as a thank you present (you'll be upgraded to their VIP instantly). If those don't apply to you, but you love candles and love gold delicate necklaces (aka Dogeared), definitely grab this box as that's worth buying alone!</p>
