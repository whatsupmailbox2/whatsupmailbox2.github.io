<p>Spoilers were released earlier for some items, but as always it's still exciting for me to actually have this box in hand.</p>

<figcaption>The info magazine</figcaption>
<br>

<p>Starting from the last box, which is the <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/FabFitFun-Subscription-Box-Fall-2015-Review-Coupon/" target="_blank">Fall 2015 Box</a>, the regular <a href="http://xo.fff.me/cwUVT" target="_blank">FabFitFun</a> info card has been replaced by a magazine. I love this change and think that the magazine is so much more informational, plus they also include fun and useful tips according to the season. So very helpful and visually stunning too!</p>

<p>Here are some pages from the info magazine:</p>

<img src="/images/FabFitFunWinter2015Info2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />

<p>The first page always lists the items in the box and their values.</p>

<p>The travel tips are very useful for the holidays since a lot of us will probably be travelling. Much appreciated!</p>

<br>

<H4>And here are the items inside:</H4>

<br>

<p>Everything looks so fab! I said that the Fall box might be my favorite from them in my last review, but I think this one trumps it. I can't wait to use them all!</p>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<DL>
<DT>Whitney Eve X FabFitFun Fingerless Gloves</DT>
<DD>Value $26</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love wearing gloves when it's cold outside, but it doesn't get THAT cold here in Los Angeles so I rarely wear the ones I have. These gloves are perfect though since it's fingerless and quite light in material, I can definitely wear this.</p>

<center><a href="http://xo.fff.me/dlGvR" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/FabFitFunWinter2015WhitneyEveGloves2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

It's also great to wear around the house on my stay-at-home days, and the fingerless part makes these gloves easy to work with no matter what you're doing. Such a great item to include in a Winter themed box!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>EJH</b> Diffuser in Sweet Cookie</DT>
<DD>Value $37</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Subscribers received one of these scents: Pomegranate, Cinnamon or Lavender. Annual subscribers were able to select their choice.</i></p>

<p>Although I prefer fresh scents to fill my house, this Sweet Cookie is perfect for the holidays. It makes my house smell like baked cookies, the only downfall is that I now constantly want to eat cookies! Thanks FabFitFun.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>FabFitFun</b> Wine Stopper and Charm Set</DT>
<DD>Value $15</DD>
</DL>

<p>I prefer these type of silicone wine stoppers because I feel they provide a tighter enclosure compared to the stainless steel ones, so this was a great item for me. The design is not really my style, but it's cute and fun, and will definitely be used!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Dermalogica</b> Skincare Set</DT>
<DD>Value $45</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: The Skin Smoothing Cream has an inner foil seal</i></p>

<p>I love Dermalogica, I have a few of their products and they're great on my skin. This set has all the basics for your daily skincare needs and the size is perfect for travelling. I'm sure a lot of us will be travelling during the holiday season, so this set will surely help! FYI, a 20% off coupon was also included in this set.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>FRENDS</b> The Donna Earbuds in Black & Gold</DT>
<DD>Value $80</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: The earbuds did not come in any box or packaging except the pouch</i></p>

<p><i>Subscribers received one of these colors: White & Silver, Black & Rose Gold or Black & Gold</i></p>

<p>I'm already a proud owner of a FRENDS Taylor Headphones and I'm currently wearing them right now as I'm writing this review. I love the Taylor headphones, but this Donna earbuds falls short in my view. First off, it doesn't fit my ears perfectly (but that just might be me as I do have small ears), and the design looks somewhat plain to me. It's still a great addition to the box and I'm sure this will make a great gift, but I certainly would not have paid $80 for these earbuds.</p>

</a></center>
<figcaption>Closer look at the earbuds</figcaption>

<p>Earbuds are great for when you want to listen to music and are wearing big chunky earrings. Wearing headphones would just press your earrings onto your ears and that's not a comfortable feeling. I wish I could use this, but as I mentioned before, it doesn't fit my ears perfectly so off it goes to be gifted.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>JUARA</b> Candlenut Body Creme</DT>
<DD>Value $35</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This came with an inner foil seal</i></p>

<center><a href="http://xo.fff.me/dlGvR" target="_blank">

</a></center>

<p>I had somewhat of a hard time taking the seal off of this jar, and once I had it all off, some of the body creme found its way to my hands and wow, it smells heavenly. It's rich and so moisturizing, I think this has got to be my new favorite lotion!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Zoya</b> Nail Polish in Blair</DT>
<DD>Value $9</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Subscribers received one of four berry-toned hues: Vanessa, Sasha, Dakota or Blair</i></p>

<p>I'm already a fan of Zoya. They're a 3-free polish and their colors are named after Female names. I have quite a collection of their colors and I find them to last long and application has always been smooth.</p>

</a></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>Shoptiques</b> $25 Gift Card</DT>
</DL>

<p>The packaging on this gift card is so cute and well made! It's definitely gift giving worthy and it doesn't have any FabFitFun saying on it at all. I've never heard of Shoptiques until now, so I went to their website and they're an online platform for all boutique shops in America to sell their products. Remember that cool unique small gift shop you visited in your last trip, most of these shops don't have a website but now you can get their items through Shoptiques. I like it and I've already used the gift card to buy something special for myself. I'll be visiting this website more often now!</p>

<DT><b>Sweet and Spark</b> $40 Gift Card</DT>
</DL>

<p>I've received a gift card from them in a previous Popsugar box. I haven't even used that one yet, but it's mostly because all their jewelry that's priced below $50 are mostly sold out, so I keep checking back to see if they add more. What's great is that their gift cards, including this one, never expires.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Hello Fresh 3 Free Meals Coupon</DT>
</DL>

<p>I have a ton of these coupons from various subscription boxes, and now I have one more. I've tried them before (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Hello-Fresh-May-2015-Review/" target="_blank">read my past review here</a>) and they're a great subscription to have if you like to cook at home but don't have time to constantly buy fresh ingredients. It also makes it easy to plan your dinner meals as each box comes with not only the ingredients of your selected meals (they come out with new dishes every week), but also a detailed recipe card on how to cook it. It was so easy that even my husband who's specialty is toasting bread, could follow and actually cooked a meal for me.</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT>ASPCA Info</DT>
</DL>

<p><a href="http://xo.fff.me/dlGvR" target="_blank">FabFitFun</a> is raising awareness to animal cruelty with ASPCA. The ASPCA is the first animal welfare organization in North America to lead the way in fighting cruelty and ending animal homelessness. For every cute picture you post with the hashtags #FFFAnimalLove #FabFitFun #ASPCA and tag @FabFitFun and @ASPCA on Instagram, they'll donate $1 to the ASPCA.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> <a href="http://xo.fff.me/dlGvR" target="_blank">FabFitFun</a> has been getting better and better! The items in this box were amazing and even the gift cards too, especially since they look and function as an actual gift card! Sometimes they're more like a coupon and require a minimum purchase, or the items they sell cost way more than the value of the gift card. I think they captured the Winter theme perfectly with the items included, and the total value came up to $312 which is amazing for a $50 box (or $40 if you purchased through my peronsal <a href="http://xo.fff.me/dlGvR" target="_blank"> link for $10 off</a>). Next shipment is Spring 2016, and I sure can't wait to see what they're planning for that box! I'll be posting spoilers as they become available, so check back regularly.</p>
