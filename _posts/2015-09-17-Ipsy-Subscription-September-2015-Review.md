<p>Ipsy always ships their bags in bright neon pink padded envelopes, it's hard to miss it!</p>

<p>Ipsy is very similar to Birchbox where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependent on the answers you give in the Ipsy beauty quiz. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items. And you can retake the beauty quiz at anytime if you feel that the products didn't really match you.</p>

<p>This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.</p>

<br>

<p>Every month Ipsy sends their items in makeup bags that they produce exclusively. September's theme is "Face Fashion" and I'm guessing it's in line with New York Fashion Week happening right now. So it's only appropriate to design this month's bag to be all glitzy, gold and glam!</p>

<p>They also include a card noting the theme for the month and in the back is a short note from them and as always, a chance to win one-year of Glam Bag subscription.</p>
<br>

<H4>And here are my items:</H4>

<p>Doesn't it look all glam?! I love it!</p>

<DD>Full Size 2.5 g, Value $18</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love lip products, I can never have enough of them so I was happy to get this in my bag. As summer is closing and we're entering Fall and Winter, this is when I transition the colors of my makeup to darker and bolder colors.</p>

</a></center>

<p>Starlet Cocktail is a deep red berry color that's just perfect for me and for the season. Plus it's vegan, paraben-free and cruelty-free.</p>

<p>Getting a palette in my bag is just awesome, especially since this one is an Ipsy exclusive! The three colors are quite versatile and can be used lightly for day or darker for night. The light gold and brown colors have shimmer while the dark brown color is matte. I can surely play around with these eyeshadows and it's such a great size for traveling!</p>

<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 7.5ml/.25fl.oz., Value $7 (Full Size 30ml $27.50)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I actually have a Temptu Airbrush Machine and have been using it for years. I love the brand and I have no complaints, if anything I rave about them. I haven't used their highlighters though so I'm more than happy to try this out. You can apply this highlighter with your fingertips, brush or sponge and use it anywhere you want light to be reflected to give your face a pop of radiance.</p>

<DD>Travel Size 20g, Value $5.50 (Full Size 120g $32)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I received this cleanser previously from another subscription and I still haven't finished that bottle yet. It worked well for my oily/combination skin so I'm happy to add another one into my skincare collection. It's also vegan, paraben-free and cruelty-free.</p>

<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 3-pan 1.7g, Value $3.50 (Full Size 6-pan 5.76g $12)</DD>
</DL>

<p>This sample is quite small, but since it's for brows, it'll probably still last me for quite some time. It consists of two eyebrow shades and a highlighter. I think I'll be able to use these shades either separately or combined as sometimes I like to go lighter more natural and other times I like them dark and defined.</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This month was great, absolutely much better than last month thankfully. I got 2 palettes and a lip product, yay! I actually love every single item in my bag and will surely be using them. The value is also definitely there for me if not more, and I absolutely loved this month's bag design too. Ipsy got it right again this month!</p>
