<p>Double OMG!!! I love 1951 Maison Francaise and I can't believe they're including one of these gorgeous clutches in the box! These beauties were first introduced to us thanks to <a href="https://ouipleasebox.com" target="_blank">Oui Please</a>, and now it's all the rage here in North America! It's nearly impossible to get one here.</p>

<p>When you purchase this Special Edition box, you'll get to choose the color/design of your clutch as shown below:</p>

</a></center>

<p>The value of the clutch itself is around $130, and this is just 1 out of 6 items that you'll receive in the box. I knew I had to have one so I ordered the Tigre color (I love animal prints).</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> ONLY available for pre-order purchase through October 9th 2015 until 5pm EST. 3 days ONLY or while supplies last!</p>
