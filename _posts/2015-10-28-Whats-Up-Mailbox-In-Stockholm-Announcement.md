<p>Hey guys! I haven't been posting anything lately (so so sorry) and that's because I'm travelling in Europe right now! I'll be away for a couple more weeks, so instead of my regular posts of subscription boxes or products, I'll be posting pics from the cities that I visit. First stop, STOCKHOLM!</p>

<br>

<figcaption>Hotel Esplanade at "Strandvägen" in the posh area (Östermalm) of Stockholm</figcaption>

<br>

<p>Right in front of the hotel is a harbour where there are docks for all the boat tours as well as some cruise ships. It's quite central in Stockholm hence the posh area.</p>

<br>

<figcaption>Danvikshem, a beautiful and historical retirement home</figcaption>

<br>

<p>This building was designed by Aron Johansson and built between 1902 and 1915. The building is set in a beautiful location overlooking Stockholm's harbour entrance.</p>

<figcaption>Tivoli Gröna Lund, Stockholm's amusement park</figcaption>

<figcaption>Another view of Gröna Lund</figcaption>

<br>

<p>I've been to the Tivoli in Denmark which is much bigger in size, but I believe this one has more rides. You can dine in one of the restaurants there, enjoy a pentathlon, a live concert or ride in one of their 30 exciting rides.</p>

<figcaption>A cafe cable car, so unique!</figcaption>

<br>

<p>You can literally go to your destination and have coffee or tea while you're travelling on the cable car, how amazing is that! We need this back home stat!</p>

<figcaption>An old windmill at the Skansen Park</figcaption>

<br>

<p>Skansen is an open-air museum and zoo where you get to see Nordic animals as well as traditional houses and lifestyle of the Nordics from old times. They have replicas of the old houses and farms where you can enter and see their workers re-enacting the way of life way back then. Such an insightful experience, I highly recommend if you ever visit Stockholm!</p>

<p>So that's it for now, but don't worry, I'll be posting more pics soon as I continue on my adventure! =) Hope you enjoyed the pics!</p>
