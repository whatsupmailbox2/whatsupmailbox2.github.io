<H4><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> Breaking News: Their next box "Oui Please Vol. 1.6 White Winter in the Alps" will include a 1951 Maison Fran√ßaise clutch!!!</H4>

<p>If you're a long time subscription addict (like me), or a true French lover (me again!), you'll know that these clutches are hard to get and a hot item to have in the fashion accessory world. I am so excited about this spoiler and hope I get one (the zebra pretty please!) #soexcited</p>

<p>The Vol 1.6 box is still available as of right now, but I forsee them getting sold out soon as this spoiler just came out today. So if you're interested, hurry up and <a href="http://ouipleasebox.com" target="_blank"><big>subscribe here</big></a> and use coupon code <b>OUIWHATSUP</b> to get 20% off. That brings the cost down to $120 for a box that may include this gorgeous clutch!</p>
