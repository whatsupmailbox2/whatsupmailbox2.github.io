<p><b>The Box:</b> <a href="http://www.luxorbox.com/#!become-a-member/cjg9" target="_blank">Luxor Box December 2015 Special Edition Box</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $175 to the US, $195 to Canada + Free shipping.</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> 6 unique luxurious gifts that have a total value of $500+!</p>

<p>When I heard that this Special Edition box would include a 1951 Maison Francaise clutch, I immediately went online and purchased one. It was like I was in a race to buy this box and checkout before it gets sold out. My fingers never typed so fast. #truestory</p>

<p>They offered different clutches to choose from to be included in the box:</p>

<p>I chose the Tigre pattern since I wanted something less conservative ;)</p>
<br>

<p>So let's get on to unboxing this beauty!</p>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxDec2015SpecialEditionPackage.jpg"></center>
<p>They shipped with their typical white boxes that they use for their subscription boxes. White and unmarked, making it safe from prying eyes.</p>

<p>The box is nicely tucked inside and arrives in perfect condition.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>1951 Maison Française</b> Large Clutch in Tigre</DT>
<DD>Value $130 (the stated value includes additional customs and shipping fee from France)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I purchased this box exclusively to obtain this clutch and I'm sure most people who bought it also had the same motive. It's highly coveted and is extremely popular in the swap world! This clutch is made from genuine cowhide leather. It includes an attachable gold shoulder chain strap and dust cover. You can attach the gold chain to use it as a crossbody, or use without as a clutch. And of course, as the name suggests, it's made in France.</p>

<p>Note that this is the Large size which is smaller than the ones that were in the Oui Please box, those were XL size. This clutch measures approximately 9" x 5.5".</p>
<br>

<p>Inside you can see their trademark 100% cotton red lining with white polka dots, and of course the 1951 branding.</p>
<p>I am in love with my clutch, it's just gorgeous and I can't wait to <strike>wear</strike> show it off!</p>

<DT><b>Deepa Gurnani</b> Claire Fantasy Flower Skinny Cuff</DT>
<DD>Value $90</DD>
</DL>

<p>I think I've received a different type of accesory from this brand in the past 3 months from different subscription boxes, such a coincidence. Either way, I'm happy it's a bracelet and not another headband or necklace, at least it's something new!</p>

<p>Like most of her accesories, the style or look is that of boho chic with a dazzling touch of glam. I like it because it's not too gaudy and yet still manages to glamour up your look without overdoing it. I can use this bracelet to either dress up or down.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxDec2015SpecialEditionDeepaGurnani2.jpg"></center>

<p>I'm always wary when I receive bracelets because I have such a petite sized wrist, but I'm so glad this is adjustable!</p>

<br>

<p>Here's a look at the bracelet on my wrist:</p>
<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxDec2015SpecialEditionDeepaGurnani3.jpg"></center>

<p>I like how it looks on me, I can totally wear this to add a bit of sparkle on days when I decide to go casual.</p>

<br>

<p>And here's a look at the back of the bracelet on my wrist:</p>
<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxDec2015SpecialEditionDeepaGurnani4.jpg"></center>

<p>You can see the adjustable beaded tassle fastening on the back. I like the tassle, I think it adds to the overall boho chic look.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxDec2015SpecialEditionJesseCoCatchall.jpg"></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>Jesse & Co</b> Hope & Love Catchall</DT>
<DD>Value $130</DD>
</DL>

<p>This leather valet tray/cathcall looks gorgeous. It's made in America with the finest Italian leather, embossed with the positive words of Hope & Love. And to top it off, it's accented with 14kt gold finished closures. Yes, yes, yes! I'm in love with this! I can't wait to throw all my knick knacks in here.</p>
<br>

<p>A closer look at the tray:</p>
<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxDec2015SpecialEditionJesseCoCatchall2.jpg"></center>

<p>In case you're wondering, the sides don't unclasp, it's permanently shaped that way so you can't lay it flat. I already have one that's able to do that for traveling purposes, so this will permanently stay next to my bed!</p>

<DT><b>Tatcha</b> Polished Rice Enzyme Powder</DT>
<DD>Value $65</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've received this before from the <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/products/reviews/Popsugar-Must-Have-Special-Edition-Fall-2015-Box-Review/" target="_blank">Popsugar Special Edition Fall 2015 Box</a>, but I'm happy to have it again because they are truly amazing. This rice powder is a cleanser that is water-activated. So you wet your palms with a bit of water, then dispense some of the powder onto your palms and voila, you get a creamy lather that is ready to be massaged onto your face to achieve a glowing and radiant skin.</p>

<p>"Nourishing Japanese rice bran blends with papaya extracts to address fine lines, uneven skintone, hyperpigmentation, and breakouts. Crushed pearl conditions and balances skin while natural exfoliants gently buff away dullness and dead skin cells."</p>

<DT><b>Graphic Image</b> 2016 Notebook</DT>
<DD>Value $70</DD>
</DL>

<p>What a beautiful planner. It's bound in rose gold leather and the size is just right at 5" x 7", not too small and not too large.</p>
<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxDec2015SpecialEditionGraphicImageNotebook2.jpg"></center>
<p>It includes a weekly schedule plus a full page of notes on the opposite page. It also has month view and some useful maps on the back pages for travel purposes. I love it and can't wait to use it next year. It'll be one of my new year's resolution, to better manage my time! =)</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>eInvite</b> "Hello" Correspondence Cards</DT>
<DD>8 cards & envelopes, Value $29.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>These cards feel and look luxurious. It's made with thick cream card stock, with a second layer in gold Lustre paper creating a thickness that feels quality. It has a "hello..." greeting in raised gold ink that will surely be useful for any type of correspondence. Included are cream envelopes that are hand-lined with Italian-imported Vintage paper.</p>

<p>I love how the cards are housed in a neat package. I'm all about organization so this was totally appreciated. It's a pretty sturdy and gorgeous looking case too, so it can be gifted as well.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This is such a great Special Edition box, well done Luxor Box! I absolutely love every single item and they all represent luxury well. From the most coveted 1951 Maison Française clutch, down to the Hello greeting cards. I think they did a great job in curating it with items that are mostly accessories with the exception of the Tatcha rice powder, but even that is considered luxury skincare. I like it better when there's less beauty/skincare items. I have more than enough of that in my stash, probably to last me 2 lifetimes! Each item is also packaged ready to be gifted, but who are we kidding here, I'm saving each one of them for myself! =P In summary, this box is definitely worth the price and I'm so glad I splurged and got this box!</p>

<p>FYI, this box is sold out and not available anymore, but Luxor Box has a bi-monthly subscription box as well and the next shipment will be in January 2016.
