<p>After receiving my first Sprezza Box last month, which was awesome by the way, I couldn't wait to open this baby up!</p>

<DT>And here are the items:</DT>

<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

<p><center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2015Watch.jpg'></center></p>
<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.arvowear.com/watches/" target="_blank">Arvo Watch</a></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $64.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>OMG, this watch is gorgeous. So classy and dapper, perfect for any gentleman and it was a total hit for my husband. He wore it as soon as I showed it to him.</p>

<center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2015Watch2.jpg'></center>
<p>I love the details on this watch, and my husband likes everything that is clean and simple in design so this was a perfect match.</p>

<center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2015Watch3.jpg'></center>
<center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2015Watch4.jpg'></center>
<p>The back of the watch is pretty cool too. The words on it is fun and playful.</p>
<br>

<DT><a href="http://www.thegrunionrun.com/inc/sdetail/10824" target="_blank">Grunion Run - White Polka Dot Pocket Square</a></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $15</DD>
</DL>

<p>Thanks to Sprezza Box, my husband now loves wearing pocket squares for that extra dapper to complete any outfit. The design on this one is modern yet cool, and I think it will go well with summer jackets, but also pretty versatile for any occasion.</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2015Socks.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.jimmylion.com/shop/mens-dots-sock" target="_blank">Jimmy Lion Dots Sock</a></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $14</DD>
</DL>

<p>You can never have enough socks, that's my husband's motto. And I'm happy that most subscription boxes for men tend to include a pair of socks so his collection is growing with cool and funky designs.</p>

<p>These socks match the pocket square and will go perfectly together in an outfit. I love how Sprezza Box includes items that go well together, so convenient and thoughtful!</p>
<br>

<DL>
<DT>Dappered Man Money Clip</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $10</DD>
</DL>

<p>Ever since I introduced money clips to my husband, he rarely wears his regular wallet. This one is a great addition. Probably not one to use everyday, but good for when you're wearing suits.</p>

<p>FYI, wallets shouldn't be placed in suit pants or you can stretch out the pockets. Use money clips instead so you can keep your dapper suits in shape =)</p>

<center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2015Clip2.jpg'></center>
<center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2015Clip3.jpg'></center>
<p>It's simple in design, but I think that's great because this way it'll match any outfit.</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2015Balm.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.novascotiafisherman.com/collections/all/products/nova-scotia-fisherman-rescue-balm" target="_blank">Nova Scotia Fisherman - Rescue Balm</a></DT>
<DD>Travel Size 0.35 oz, Value $4</DD>
</DL>

<p>This balm can be used on hands, feet, elbows, lips and more. It's made from all natural ingredients like chamomile, shea butter, lavender, and sea kelp to heal irritated or chapped skin. No animal testing, no petroleum based ingredients and paraben free.</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I'm at awe of how great this box was! The watch was a pleasant surprise and I'm still happily in shock at the inclusion of such an amazing item in this box! Everything else was great quality and complemented each other well. The total value came up to $107.99 and that's an amazing value for a $28 subscription box! Sprezza Box continues to amaze both my husband and I, keep it up Sprezza! And if I had to be honest, I'm secretly jealous of my husband for having such an awesome subscription ;) This is my favorite box from them so far and I can't wait to see what they're planning for next month!</p>
