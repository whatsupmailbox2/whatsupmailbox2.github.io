<p>I always get excited when my Beauty DNA box is here, I just never know or can ever guess what I'll be receiving!</p>

<p>Beauty DNA is a completely different experience than other beauty subscriptions. They send out one full-sized product that's matched with your skin concerns or needs. When you join, there's a "Beauty Profile" (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/Beauty-DNA-August-2015-Review/" target="_blank">you can see my August review where I explain their Beauty Profile</a>) that you need to complete and this is how they match you with your product. It didn't take me long at all to complete it and I also like the fact that you can access your Beauty Profile anytime and modify it if you ever have any changes in your skincare needs.</p>

<H4>Based on my Beauty Profile, here is the item they matched me with:</H4>

<DL>
<DT>Epionce Renewal Facial Cream</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size 1 ml, Value $94</DD>
</DL>

<p>I actually need a moisturizer that's deeply hydrating for the winter months, so I was happy to find this in the box. It was matched based on my preference of ingredients, which is free of paraben and fragrance, as well as my skin concerns which are anti-aging and dry skin.</p>

<br>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNAOct2015Info.jpg'></center></p>
<p>Beauty DNA always includes a detailed Beauty Report about the product and why they matched it for you (me).</p>

<p>They also included a small spatula so that you can scoop up the cream without using your hands. It helps your cream last longer as well as keep it more sterile.</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I'm very pleased with the item they matched me with this month. I really did need a good moisturizer and now I have one plus it's valued at $94! For $25, that's an amazing deal, especially when you love the product. It's always such a surprise (a good one so far) to receive my monthly Beauty DNA boxes, you just never know what you're gonna get! =)</p>
