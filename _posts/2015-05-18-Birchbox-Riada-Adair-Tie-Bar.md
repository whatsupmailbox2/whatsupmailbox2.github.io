<br>

<br>

<p>The reason why I love <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox">Birchbox</a> is the ability to earn my money back by reviewing the items I received. Each item you review will earn you 10 Birchbox points which equals to $1. You can redeem every 100 points for $10 in the Birchbox shop. And since I have a subscription to both <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox">Birchbox</a> and <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox">Birchbox Man</a>, I rack up points quickly.</p>

<p>Tie bars are so in right now and this birch wood finish is oh so perfect for the summer. #HelloHandsome</p>

<p>To get your tie bar, you can subscribe <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox">here</a> to start your monthly subscription and get the tie bar included in your first month's box.</p>
