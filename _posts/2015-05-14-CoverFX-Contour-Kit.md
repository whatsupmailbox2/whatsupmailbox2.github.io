<p><b>The Product:</b> <a href="http://www.coverfx.com/contour-kit.html">Cover FX Contour Kit in G Medium Deep</a></p>
<p><b>The Price:</b> $48</p>

<p>I purchased this contour kit at <a href="http://www.sephora.com/contour-kit-P393632?skuId=1676246">Sephora</a> after it got such amazing reviews, and I can see why. 
I love Cover FX and use their powder and foundation daily, it has been my go to makeup for 2 years now. I discovered Cover FX because I have sensitive skin and ingredients are important to me,
so when I researched for a new foundation that would be safe and healthy for my skin, I found Cover FX to be the best.</p>

<p>Here's their brand philosophy which I highly respect and am a loyal fan because of that:</p>
<blockquote>We take ingredient choices seriously which is why each product is packed with vitamins, 
emollients and redness reducers plus Free of the Inflammatory 5: parabens, fragrance, gluten, mineral oil and talc. 
To go a step further and ensure each product is safe for even the most sensitive of skin, 
all Cover FX formulas are developed under the supervision of dermatologists and clinically tested, for a truly healthy foundation.</blockquote>

<b>VERDICT:</b> The included guide with picture made this kit so easy to contour! The colors are perfect (not muddy at all) and it was easy to blend -super easy to be precise. 
I have oily skin and this was matte upon application. There is a more illuminated shimmer color (number 2) for your brows and cheek bones (pretty much anywhere you want to give a pop of highlight), 
but other than that, great for oily or combination skin. And of course the fact that they are made with healthy and safe ingredients makes this contour kit a slam dunk. Another great item by Cover FX!</p>
