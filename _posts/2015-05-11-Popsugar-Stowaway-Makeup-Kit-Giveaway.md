A little about Stowaway Cosmetics:
<blockquote>Stowaway knows that if you're on the move, your beauty products are, too. Stowaway is a cosmetics brand built on the philosophy that makeup should be designed to go wherever women go. Its makeup formulas feel as good as they look and come in sizes you can carry anywhere â€” you'll also finish them before they expire. To top it off, they are always paraben-, phthalate-, and cruelty-free! Finally, the makeup you love in the sizes you can carry.</blockquote>
