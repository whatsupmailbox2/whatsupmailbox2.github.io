<ul>
<li>1 month $24 (reg. $30.95)</li>
<li>3 months $69.99 (reg. $86.95)</li>
<li>6 months $119 (reg. $167.70)</li>

<p>As you can see from the prices above, the 6-months deal is where you save the most, but if you're not ready to commit that long, the 1-month deal is pretty good too if you just want to try them out.</p>

<p>I always purchase through Ruelala for subscriptions that I'm not currently subscribed to and would like to try out. You always save money through these deals, that's why I recommend them to everyone!</p>

<p>*Note: By purchasing on Ruelala, you will be enrolled in their monthly subscription plan after your period ends, so make sure to cancel prior if you don't plan on keeping the subscription. You can cancel through your online account so no need for awkward phone calls here.</p>

<p>If you haven't heard of Rue La La, its a website that has boutique sales and frequently also deals on subscription boxes. You can <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank"><big>JOIN HERE</big></a> to start browsing what's on sale now or to purchase the subscription deal. I totally recommend them!</p>
