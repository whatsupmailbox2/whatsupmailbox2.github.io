<p>I love me a good deal and lately I've been shopping a lot of them through <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy</a>. Not only do they have a great subscription that I receive monthly (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Ipsy-Subscription-January-2016-Review/" target="_blank">you can read my Ipsy January 2016 review here</a>), but they also come out with monthly offers as well that's hard to resist!</p>

<p>Last week they offered a set of Hanalei Sugar Body Polish & Lip Scrub (both full sizes) for only $16 which is an insane deal since the two of them have a combined retail value of $55, so this set was 70% off! I knew I just had to get it. Plus you can never have enough scrubs.</p>

<br>

<p>Here's a look at the Body Polish:</p>

<br>

<p>You can definitely feel the sugar in this scrub which I love, it will surely slough off any dry skin I have. But it also has essential oils in it so it feels both moisturizing and silky at the same time.</p>

<p>Hanalei uses real cane sugar to exfoliate your skin and Sunflower oil to nourish and help maintain a smooth texture. It also uses kukui nut oil that contains high levels of amino acids, which relieves dryness and rehydrates. Plus it's free of parabens, phthalates, and is cruelty free. An all around great body scrub that not only exfoliates well but safely too!</p>

<br>

<p>And on to the lip scrub:</p>

<br>

<p>My lips are constantly dry no matter what the season is. It gets extra dry of course during winter, and that's when lip scrubs come to my rescue. I've used the Fresh Sugar Lip Scrub in the past and wanted to try this one out to compare. First off, the application is slightly different in which the Fresh lip scrub requires you to wash it off with water after scrubbing, while this Hanalei lip scrub only asks you to wipe it off with tissue after. How convenient. This way I can scrub my lips anywhere and anytime, I like that.</p>

<p>Hanaleiâ€™s lip scrub uses real Maui sugar crystals. How exotic. I love the island Maui, it's one of my favorite places to go for a tropical, snorkelling vacation. I've gone in both winter (which is pretty much like summer but slightly cooler), and summer (just last year in fact) and the weather is perfect no matter the season. I'll surely be thinking of this beautiful island everytime I use this.</p>

<p>This scrub also has pure kukui nut oil from Hawaii that contains vital fatty acids and vitamins A, C, and E to naturally soothe your lips. Shea butter is also used to help lock in moisture and restore softness after exfoliation. And of course, it's also paraben free.</p>

<p>I really love this lip scrub, I might have to carry this with me everywhere!</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I'm so happy I bought this awesome deal! I've used both the scrubs and my skin and lips are loving it. Winters got nothing on me! That's what my skin said as I was scrubbing away in the shower. And yeah, saving 70% off retail price was just the icing on the cake. FYI, this set is sold out already (I looked yesterday to see if I can buy some more). So if you want to take part in amazing <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy</a> offers like this, subscribe and join at <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">www.ipsy.com</a> and don't miss another awesome deal like this again =)</p>
