<p>They package their boxes inside of another box for shipping purposes, and I like that because it ensures that the <a href="https://www.glossybox.com/referal?CI=MTMzODY3" target="_blank">Glossybox</a> itself comes without dents, scratches and in perfect condition.</p>

<p>OMG, how amazing is this month's box! I love everything French so this just made my day! I can see a few of their famous landmarks - Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, Louvre and of course the famous cafe, Les Doux Magots. Best box design they've sent so far, aaaahhhh can't get enough of how cute this box is!!!</p>

<p>With every box that they send, they also include a fold out info card that details the items and prices.</p>

<H4>And here are my items:</H4>

<DD>Full Size 0.17 oz, Value $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>La Reine Soleil translates to Queen Sun. It does smell like a sunny day in a field of flowers - feminine, fresh and floral - that's how I would describe this.</p>

<p>Lately I've been more open and adventurous with new fragrances thanks to all my subscription boxes, so I was actually happy to add this French perfume into my collection. Especially since this perfume is in a solid stick form which makes it oh-so travel friendly.</p>

<br>

<p>This box comes sealed with a cute sticker that says, "Come in".</p>

</a></center>

<p>It has a plastic seal on top of it to keep the perfume safe and fresh until it gets to your hands.</p>

<p>Here's a look at the perfume stick closer with it twisted up a bit so you can see the actual product.</p>

<p>I actually love the scent of this perfume, surprisingly. It's convenient to travel with since it's not liquid, and the packaging is cute!</p>

<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 1oz., Value $12 based on Sephora (Full Size 5oz., $32)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I use and love products by Phyto. Not only are they great and work wonders for my hair, they smell amazing too and this one doesn't disappoint. I use a straightening iron as well as a curling iron quite frequently, so this is a must in my hair routine. It protects hair from heat, but it also detangles and prevents breakage. Great item and I'll be buying a full size of this!</p>

<p>Red lips are très chic, this is a fact. Personally it reminds me of Paris and Moulin Rouge and since I'll be going to Europe at the end of this month, I will totally be using this while I'm there. It will brighten up any winter day =)</p>

<p>The color is bright red and it has a slight scent of Cherry. Application is smooth and glossy as you would expect. What a great French lip gloss to include, definitely a keeper and so happy to have this.</p>

<DD>Full Size .4 fl.oz., Value $10</DD>
</DL>

<p>A Parisian look (or red lips) wouldn't be complete without red nails. It's a fashion classic that never goes out of style. Voyage à Paris (Paris Trip) is a bright red color that matches the De Bruyère lipgloss. Application only took one coat and it was all set. I love how easy it was to paint my nails with this.</p>

<p>This exact nail polish is actually available from Birchbox UK, but sadly not here. And another interesting fact, it's also from the same parent company as De Bruyère Paris. What a great combo to insert for this French-themed box.</p>

<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 15ml., Value $10.50 (Full Size 50ml, $35)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've heard of this brand but never used anything by them. This is a night cream that will restore and repair your skin while you sleep. It's paraben free and safe for sensitive skin. It promises smoother, more luminous, and rested-looking skin. We shall see about that. The size is quite good to try for a month I believe, so I'm happy about that, but I typically only use a smal amount when it comes to night creams since I have combination/oily skin, so perhaps that's why it tends to last longer for me.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Best <a href="https://www.glossybox.com/referal?CI=MTMzODY3" target="_blank">Glossybox</a> EVER! I absolutely love everything, from the box to all the products. It's hard for us here in the USA to discover and try out new French brands, and I'm absolutely grateful that they decided to do this French-themed box, so thankful. Plus the total value came up to more than triple the cost, that's amazing. The box itself is a work of art which I will be using as decoration and to keep all things French in there. I truly hope <a href="https://www.glossybox.com/referal?CI=MTMzODY3" target="_blank">Glossybox</a> comes out with more themed boxes like this, maybe UK next? ;)</p>
