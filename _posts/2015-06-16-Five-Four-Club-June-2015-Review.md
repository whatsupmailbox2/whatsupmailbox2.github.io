<p>I decided to sign my husband up for this service to see how well their products and styling service are.</p>

<p>First off, you take a profile survey to input your size and style preferences. My husband is in the "Fashion Forward" category with a preference in vibrant and rich colors, and pants that are slim fit.</p>

<H4>Based on that profile, here is what they sent:</H4>

<DT>Kemp Shirt in <i>Dark Blue</i></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $60</DD>
</DL>

<p>I was surprised they sent a dark blue shirt even though the profile specifically stated vibrant and rich colors, but my husband still likes the shirt and the fit was true to size.</p>
<p>This shirt is made with 100% cotton which hubby totally appreciated, and the pattern actually works well for summer. It can be worn with dark, light or even white jeans.</p>
<p>The tortoise buttons also gave it a nice summer touch</p>

<DT>Hite pants in <i>Navy</i></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $68</DD>
</DL>

<p>Another dark item, but it still works out (you can always use another dark blue pants in your collection) and the fit was totally on point.</p> 
<p>My husband is slim and tall, and even though some brands market their pants as slim fit, sometimes it still can be off and looks more straight than slim. I'm glad these were a perfect fit!</p>
<p>The material is made of 98% cotton and 2% elastane. Again... perfect. Because it stretches, it makes these pants comfortable to wear even though it's slim fit and you feel like you're moving with the pants and not that stiff material feeling.</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Although the colors were mostly dark, hubby actually loved both items and both he and I were glad the fit was accurate. The quality is definitely there and the style on trend. Both items totaled up to $128, but with the subscription it only costs $60 which is pretty fair for a shirt and pants. I think this is a great subscription for men who are busy and don't have time to shop, or for those who need an outside intervention to their daily wardrobe. I'll continue to subscribe for my husband and I'm curious to see if they'll brighten up the colors for next month's package. I sure hope so, it's summer after all!</p>
