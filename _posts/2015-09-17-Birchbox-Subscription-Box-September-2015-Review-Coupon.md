<p>This box was designed to celebrate Birchbox customers as they celebrate their 5-year anniversary. The message is uplifting and the design is quite artistic. I'll be displaying this box on top of my vanity to remind me everyday that no matter what "you're beautiful" ;)</p>

<p>I received 6 items this month (one of them is a bonus sample packet) and off the bat I noticed the big sized lip product!</p>
<br>

<DD>Full Size 0.12oz., Value $22</DD>
</DL>

<p>I can't believe I got a full-sized lip product, hurray!!! I've heard of Mally before but never tried any of their products, so I'm super delighted that I'll get to now. And did I mention this is a full-sized product!</p>

<p>This lipstick is a 4-in-1 product that includes lip primer, lipstick, lip gloss, and lip liner all in one! The texture is creamy and it does give you shine like a lip gloss. I love the color, it's very natural on my lips and the shine is perfect too. What a great item!</p>

<DD>Travel Size 22ml/0.75fl.oz., Value $3.50 (Full Size 150ml $24)</DD>
</DL>

<p>This body lotion has a triple antioxidant based formula - Organic Aloe, Organic Raspberry Butter, and Organic Shea Butter - that will soften and soothe the skin while also helping to replenish and firm. The scent is not too strong of a lavender, subtle but still smells great. It goes on creamy, not oily and absorbs pretty quickly. It also comes sealed which is a bonus in my germaphobic book.<br>

<DD>Travel Size 75ml/2.5fl.oz., Value $3.50 (Full Size $25)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've received Davines shampoos before in different varieties and I love them but I've never tried the LOVE line. So naturally when I saw this as a sample choice last month, I knew I had to choose it, especially since my hair has taken a beating from my summer outdoor activities.</p>

<p>This shampoo is enriched with olive oil and rice protein and the formula targets to smooth out frizzy and tangle-prone hair. The scent is refreshing almost spa-ish, and I've only used it once but I did notice a decrease in frizz and increase in moisturization right after the shower. This shampoo is made in Italy and is both paraben and sulfate free.</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.100percentpure.com/products/organic-coffee-bean-caffeine-eye-cream-1oz#product-info-detail" target="_blank">100% Pure - Organic Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream</a></DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 0.3 fl.oz., Value $7.50 (Full Size 1oz. $25)</DD>
</DL>

<p>First off, what I love about this particular eye cream is that, just like its name suggests, it's 100% natural and 100% vegan. The caffeine rich green tea and coffee ingredient gives anti-inflammatory benefits that improves the appearance of puffy under-eyes and brightens dark circles. So I used it this morning to brighten up my eyes and I gotta say, it feels refreshing and good on my "I need more sleep" eyes. The scent is also quite sweet, like a vanilla latte in a tube! It's probably because it HAS vanilla and coffee in its ingredients, makes sense. Although this is a deluxe sample size, you won't need much on the eyes so this will surely last me awhile.</p>

<DD>Sample Vial 1ml?, Value $7.80</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm estimating the size as there was none stated. I'm not too keen on receiving fragrances in my boxes, especially when they're not in a spray bottle. But the scent is actually pretty good. Very floral and gardenia strong. It kind of reminds me of one of the Michael Kors perfumes, which I also like. I'm glad I got to try this out!<br>

<DD>Sample Packet 12ml, Value $1.30 (Full Size 250ml $29)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I always love getting bonus items. It means extra product AND extra points for me to review which translates to more money to spend in the Birchbox shop ;)</p>
<p>This conditioner was included to pair with the shampoo that I received. Using them both together definitely helped with my frizz situation and brushing out my hair after the shower was much easier. My hair felt moisturized afterwards so no complaints here.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This month's Birchbox was amazing! I still can't believe I got a full-sized lip product worth $22, that's double the cost of the box itself! Not only that, all the other items were perfectly matched to me and I can't be more happy with them. At this point I've used every single product and all I have to say is wow, this month's box was truly perfect and the value has got to be the highest I've received so far. Well done Birchbox and happy 5th year anniversary!</p>
