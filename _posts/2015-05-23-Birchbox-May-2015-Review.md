<H4>My products:</H4>
<DL>
<DT>English Laundry - Notting Hill Femme</DT>
<DD>Sample Vial, $2</DD>
<p>It's never exciting for me to find perfume samples in subscription boxes since I think it's such a personal taste. This perfume smells very sweet and woody, not my type at all. But the whole packaging was in gold and I love gold, so at least I liked that part.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Smashbox - Photo Finish Primer Water</DT>
<DD>0.16 fl. oz. / 5 ml, $1.30</DD>
<p>This spray smelled refreshing and such a perfect size for your purse, gym bag or travelling. It's silicone-free, alcohol-free, and oil-free. I especially appreciate that it's oil free since I have combination skin. I sprayed it on earlier today and felt immediately refreshed and I do think it set my makeup, so I'm adding this to my everyday routine.</p>

<DL>
<DT>W3ll People - The Expressionist Bio Extreme Mascara</DT>
<DD>Deluxe sample size, $7?</DD>
<p>I'm not sure how to value this, there wasn't any size stated so I'm guessing by the full size and this sample, it's about 1/3 of the size and I based the value on that.</p>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>Naobay - Oxygenating Cream Moisturizing</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 20ml, $14.40</DD>
<p>A moisturizer for all skin types with ingredients such as Rosehip and Almond oil. It can also can be used as a makeup base. I've heard good things about Naobay and this moisturizer is natural and organic, so I'll definitely be using this soon.</p>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>Living Proof - Restore Hill Femme</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 30ml, $7.25</DD>
<p>I actually use Living Proof products but haven't tried this one, so I'm happy this was in my box and I can't wait to try it. Their products always deliver so I'm sure I'll love it.</p>

<p><b>My Thoughts:</b> Perfume sample aside, I actually loved this box and thought it was well curated. The total value came up to $31.95 which is great for a $10 subscription, especially when I'll be using most of the items. Definitely one of the better boxes I've received from Birchbox so far!</p>
