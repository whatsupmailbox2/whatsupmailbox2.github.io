<p>A box of natural beauty products that consists of 3 full-sized products plus a canvas tote, yes yes and YES!</p>

<p>Although there are other subscription boxes that cater to natural and organic beauty/skincare products, this has got to be the first in offering all full-sized products, yay!</p> 

<p>Most of the other subs have been discontinued and the one that's still active has been quite disappointing lately by sending out old or expired products, yikes.</p>

<p>So it was a no brainer for me to instantly fall in love with this subscription and if you're like me - a natural beauty junkie - then I totally recommend for you to check them out and subscribe.</p>

<p><i class="icon-gift"></i> Plus right now if you use the coupon code <a href="http://www.nourishbeautybox.com/ac/WHATSUPMAILBOX" target="_blank">WHATSUPMAILBOX</a> you'll get an extra box, yes TWO boxes, for the price of one. That's an awesome deal (!) and gives you more reason to try them out ;)</p>

<p>Stay tuned for my review next month of their launch box!  xoxo, Loretta</p>
