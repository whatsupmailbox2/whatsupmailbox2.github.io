<p>This month's box was designed to raise Breast Cancer awareness, hence the pink color. They've partnered with Estée Lauder's Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign and the Breast Cancer Research Foundation to fund one year of breast cancer lab research hours. I think it's great that Birchbox is being active and contributing towards this cause!</p>

<br>

<p>I received 6 items this month (one of them is a bonus sample packet). I love it when they include bonus packets in the box, it translates to extra Birchbox points for me!</p>
<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<img src="/images/BirchboxOct2015BenefitRollerLashMascara.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Benefit Roller Lash Mascara" />
</a></center>

<DL>
<DT>Benefit Roller Lash Mascara</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 3g./0.1oz., Value $8.50 (Full Size 8.5g., $24)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I chose this mascara as my sample choice due to the rave reviews I've read about it. It gives lashes major curl and it has an innovative Hook ‘n’ Roll™ brush that's coated in tiny, soft hooks, which catch onto and lift, curl, and separate each lash instantly. The brush works with any eye shape or size and varying lash types, but it works especially well with short or straight lashes, that's me!</p>

<p>I always, always curl my lashes before applying mascara because I have straight Asian lashes. But since this mascara promised to create major curl by itself, I decided to try it without curling it first and wow, it did curl my lashes! I've never seen or used anything like this, amazing! I am totally going to buy a full size version of this. Again, ah-mazing!</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT>Supergoop! Forever Young Hand Cream with Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40</DT>
<DD>Sample Size 0.14fl.oz., Value $.50 (Full Size 10oz. $34)</DD>
</DL>

<p>A hand cream that not only moisturizes your hands, but it also prevents sunspots from appearing there as well. The sample is a bit too tiny for me to see if it works though, especially since I have to use it on my hands, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to decide whether or not I love it or if it's just meh.</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT>Dear Clark Thickening Balm</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 1oz., Value $6.50 (Full Size 4oz. $26)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I have fine hair so I'll definitely benefit from using this. Not only will it make your hair fuller and thicker, it also adds shine and protects hair from heat. That's a great all-in-one!</p>

<DL>
<DT>Calypso St. Barth Figue Eau de Parfum</DT>
<DD>Sample Vial 0.05fl.oz./1.5ml., Value $1.9 (Full Size 60ml, $75)</DD>
</DL>

<p>Although I've been more open to fragrances lately and actually like receiving fragrance samples now, sadly this one was not for me. It'll be a great stocking stuffer though, so it's not a complete lost.</p>

<img src="/images/BirchboxOct2015MalinGoetzCleanserMoisturizer.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser" />
</a></center>

<DL>
<DT>Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 15ml/0.5fl.oz., Value $2 (Full Size 236ml, $32)</DD>
</DL>

<p>This cleanser feels and smells refreshing, I love the scent of grapefruit! This cleanser is great for my combination/oily skin because it eliminates oil, clears acne and balances skin's pH. I think I found another great cleanser to add to my skincare.</p>

<br>
 
<H4><i class="icon-gift"></i> Bonus item:</H4>

<DL>
<DT>Malin + Goetz Vitamin E Face Moisturizer</DT>
<DD>Sample Packet 3ml, Value $1.17 (Full Size 118ml, $46)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I always love getting bonus items. It means extra product AND extra points for me to review which translates to more money to spend in the Birchbox shop ;)</p>
<p>This moisturizer was included to pair with the cleanser. And just as well, it's also good for combination/oily skin since its ingredients is oil-free, lightweight, and provides pH balance for all skin types.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This month wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. The value is on the low side, but still double the cost so it's still worth it to me. Besides the perfume sample, I'll be using everything in this box, but my favorite has got to be hands down the Benefit Roller Lash Mascara. What an amazing find and it was such a great product, I purchased the full size right after I tested it, that's how good it was! I may need to update my beauty profile though, since there was only 1 makeup item in my box this time which is the mascara. I would like to see a more balanced selection, so hopefully next month there'll be a better mix.</p>
