<figcaption>First look at unboxing</figcaption>
<br>

<p>The June 2015 box is titled the <big>Liberty Box</big>. I'm guessing it's due to Independence Day coming up soon.</p>

<p>My initial reaction of unboxing was that everything seemed simple and classy. Box and packaging was all white with the inclusion of their logo.</p>

<DT>And here are the items:</DT>

<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

<p><center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxJune2015SocksTie.jpg'></center></p>
<DL>
<DT>American Trench Socks</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $14.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>These are mid-calf socks and are locally produced in North Carolina. The socks came in 2 variations for all subscribers and the other one had red, white and blue as the colors while this one only has red and dark blue. I think the stripes are also thinner on the other variation versus this one. My husband loves collecting socks that are all types of patterns and colors, so he was happy to add this.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Mosaic Menswear Neck Tie</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $35</DD>
</DL>

<p>This neck tie is 100% silk and the color + pattern is quite universal where it'll go with just about anything. There are 2 variations of the tie; the other one has a thicker stripe with mostly red, blue and silver for the colors. It did seem like the other pattern was more of a match for my husband's style, but he'll still be able to use this one so its not a total lost for him.</p>

<p><center><img src='/images/SprezzaBoxJune2015Others.jpg'></center></p>
<DL>
<DT>Paul Evans Shoehorn</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $18</DD>
</DL>

<p>What a coincidence, just the other day my husband was complaining and struggling to put his shoes on and couldn't find his shoehorn. This one is fancy and luxurious too since its made of leather. So long cheap plastic shoehorns and hello Paul Evans!</p>

<DL>
<DT>DHA1 Pocket Square</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $15</DD>
</DL>

<p>This pocket square is classy and the herringbone pattern can go with just about anything. I also like the fact that DHA1's mission is "an eye for fashion" where a portion of all profits go to fund eye surgeries for the blind across the world. I applaud that.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Marvis Toothpaste</DT>
<DD>Sample Size, Retail Value $1.32</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've tried this toothpaste before thanks to other subscription boxes. It's minty fresh, has a cool packaging and the size is great for travelling.</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Every item in this box was quality, useful and will definitely bump up your style. The value was definitely there too, it came up to $83.82 which is almost triple the cost! My husband and I definitely recommend this box if you love to accessorize or you're looking to upgrade your style. Hubby is happy with this box and will continue to subscribe.</p>
