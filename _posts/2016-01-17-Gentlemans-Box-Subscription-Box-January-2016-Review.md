<p>The info magazine displays the items included in the box and a little info on them as well. I love it when subscription boxes do this, it just feels quality and shows that they pay attention to the small details.</p>

# All the items in Gentleman's Box January 2016:

<center><img src='/images/GentlemansBoxJan2016Items.jpg'></center>

<br>

<p>All the items look great and I'm already so excited, especially with the inclusion of a watch, score!!!</p>

<br>

## Items in detail:

<center><img src='/images/GentlemansBoxJan2016LapelLipBalm.jpg'></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>My Suited Life</b> Wooden Lapel</DT>
<DD>Value $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>This lapel pin is made of wood so it's both innovative and unique at the same time, I like it. The style of this wooden lapel will be perfect for a spring or summer outdoor event. My husband definitely does not have a wooden lapel in his collection, so this is a first and I can't wait to see him wear it.</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT><b>Brickell</b> Peppermint Lip Balm</DT>
<DD>Value $7.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>This lip balm is made with the finest natural and organic ingredients. It's also a no shine lip balm so you or your man can moisturize and hydrate your lips without getting that girly shiny gloss that typically comes with it. Plus it also provides broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection with SPF15. Finally, a great manly lip balm that my husband can actually use!</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/GentlemansBoxJan2016Watch.jpg'></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Winner Circle Fashion Co.</b> Classic Sports Watch</DT>
<DD>Value $50</DD>
</DL>

<p>Not only is this wristwatch casual and cool at the same, they also included two additional interchangeable straps for you to switch up based on your mood or outfit. How thoughtful!</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the face dial:</p>

<br>

<p>I always like watches with a clean design, not only for aesthetics, but also because it's versatile and can fit into any outfit. What a great watch to receive and it will surely be used for many years to come.</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/GentlemansBoxJan2016HappySocks.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>Happy Socks</b> Half-Striped Socks</DT>
<DD>Value $15</DD>
</DL>

<p>My husband absolutely loves Happy Socks. They always have fun and sometimes bright patterns or designs for each pair of socks. He already has a growing collection and this one will be "happily" added to that. See what I did there =P</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> What an awesome box! All the items were great and I totally appreciate the inclusion of a wristwatch, but even more grateful that it also includes two additional interchangeable straps. Especially the camo pattern, a clear favorite. The total value of this box came up to $100.50 which is amazing for the $25 cost. This is such a great subscription to have if you're into accessorizing or want to upgrade your looks and be dapper!</p>
