<center><H4>Serendipity is a new subscription by Little Lace Box and this review is for their first launch package!</H4></center>

<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b">Serendipity by Little Lace Box</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $9.99 bi-monthly (on the off months of the Little Lace Box) with Free Shipping</p>
<p><b>Products:</b> You'll receive 5-7 sample size (sometimes full-size) items that Little Lace Box deemed great finds and wanted to share. Since it's still new, I can't really say what you probably would expect from this subscription, so I'll leave it at that for now.</p>
<p><b>Coupon:</b> Serendipity is currently FREE for current <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b">Litte Lace Box</a> subscribers, but if you haven't subscribed to <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b">Litte Lace Box</a>, use coupon code <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b">REDLACE</a> for $10 off your subscription!</p>

<p>They ship in red padded envelopes that are in line with the red boxes they ship for Little Lace Box. Nice touch.</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/SerendipityJune2015InfoCard.jpg'></center>
<p>In tradition with Little Lace Box, they've included their infamous personal letter and product info pamphlet. First they explain why they created Serendipity and then describe what it's all about.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the front page details the products included in the package, and at the back of the pamphlet is the announcement of Little Lace Box's August Theme: "Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy". What an interesting theme, August can't come soon enough!</p>
<br>

## The products:

<DL>
<DT>OFRA Cosmetics - Eyebrow Pencil in Universal</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size .04 oz., Retail Value $12.95</DD>
</DL>

<blockquote>
Water resistant pencil suitable for the most sensitive eye area. It is the perfect solution for your eyebrows and is called Universal Eyebrow Pencil for a reason as it is one color to suit all skin tones.
</blockquote>
<p>I like how this eyebrow pencil goes on smoothly and the color truly is "Universal", I'm pretty sure anyone can wear this. I do prefer mechanical pencils though since I hate sharpening plus I think it wastes product, but I'm happy to have this and will be using it till it's gone.</p>

<DL>
<DT>OFRA Cosmetics - Lip Liner in Plum</DT>
<DD>Full Size .04 oz., Retail Value $12.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>This color is quite dark and I was actually in need of a dark lip liner, so it's perfect. Since it's so dark, you can't really see any purple, just dark earthy brown with a hint of purple.</p>
<p>Application was smooth with no tugging on my lips, and this pencil is supposed to be water resistant too so the color should last. You definitely need a dark lipstick or lipgloss to fill your lips in if you use this liner. I tried multiple colors and only the really dark red/brownish lipsticks or gloss work with this. I like it though, and it goes really well with the lipgloss that they included as well. So let's get on to that item.</p>

<DL>
<DT>OFRA Cosmetics - Lip Gloss in Bordeaux</DT>
<DD>Full Size 8 g / .27 fl.oz., Retail Value $12.95</DD>
</DL>
<p>Wow, this lip gloss is dark red, and I mean dark. The info card says that it goes on sheer, but um no, it's pretty rich in color. It might be a bit too dramatic or even gothic for some, but I think it would look great on a glammed up night. Perhaps a 1920s or Burlesque theme party? Definitely not one to be used daily unless that's your look.</p>
<p>Color aside, the gloss doesn't feel sticky and has the shine of a lip gloss but not overly shiny. I'm glad I'm being introduced to more OFRA products now thanks to subscription boxes, and so far I have no complaints.</p>

<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.bellaink.com/shop/cc-31-cupcake-birthday-folded-note">Bella Ink - Cupcake Birthday Card</a></DT>
<DD>1 card with envelope, Retail Value $4</DD>
</DL>
<p>This was an unexpected item, but a good one. Every subscriber got different types of card and I'm glad I got the Birthday one. It seems I'm in need of that type of card most often.</p>

<DL>
<DT><a href='http://brode.co'>Brode - Electrolyte Vitamin</a></DT>
<DD>1 pouch with 2 tablets inside, Retail Value $4</DD>
</DL>
<p>What a great find! This vitamin promises to hydrate you with electrolytes so you can say adios to dehydration.</p>
<p>Our bodies can get dehydrated from being too active (like in sports), traveling (on a plane) or drinking (perhaps more than you should). So this vitamin is perfect for that and "studies show that 4 out of 5 people who take Brode while drinking say that they feel much better the next day, with less hangover". That's music to my ears!</p>
