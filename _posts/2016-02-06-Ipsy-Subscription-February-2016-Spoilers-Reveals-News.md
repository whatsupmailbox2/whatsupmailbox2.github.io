<p>Ipsy spoilers have been coming out lately and each subscriber will be getting one of the items from the picture above.</p>

<p>I can't say that I'm too excited about my items, I was really hoping for a Trust Fund Beauty nail polish, but Ciat√© is good too so I'll reserve my complete judgement until I have all the items on hand and test them out. What are you getting in your <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy Glam Bag</a> this month?</p>
