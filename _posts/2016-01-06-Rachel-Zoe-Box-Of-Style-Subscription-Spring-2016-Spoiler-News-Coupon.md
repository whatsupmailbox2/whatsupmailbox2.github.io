<p>The Hero Item (high value item that gets revealed for each box) for the Spring 2016 Box Of Style has been revealed and it's an exclusive Shaffer LA leather Greta bag, a $150 value!</p>

<br>

<p>"The Greta is your wing-woman for life's adventurers.  She's can be worn cross body or as a single shoulder bag.  Big enough for a phone and wallet, yet small enough to not get in the way, Greta can be closed with a knot or a bow depending your mood.  At the end of the day, Greta can go either way."</p>
