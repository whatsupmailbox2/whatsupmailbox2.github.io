<H4>The products:</H4>
<DL>
<DT>Balla for Men - Body Powder</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Travel Size 10.3g, $5</DD>
<p>The size was big for a sample! This was perfect for my husband since we live in California and the heat can sometimes get to his body. It also has a tingle formula so somewhat like a cooling effect when you put it on, the bottle even says "air conditioning for the soul"!</p>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>Davines - Momo Shampoo</DT>
<DD>Travel size 75 ml / 2.5 fl.oz., $7.50</DD>
<p>Another item that my husband loved! Plus it's quite a substantial size again for a sample, so it'll be perfect for traveling and can last my husband for 2 weeks if needed. Their ingredients are safe and I also liked the fact that the company donates 1% of all purchases to "1% For the Planet" to support environmental charities.</p>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>English Laundry - Signature Eau De Parfum</DT>
<DD>Sample Vial 2ml, $2?</DD>
<p>Although perfume samples are items that I would rather not see in any of my subscriptions, this one actually was good for my husband. The scent is fresh which he loves and will be perfect for spring and summer.</p>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>Happy Socks - 2 pairs</DT>
<DD>Men's size 10-13, $12 each</DD>
<p>My husband chose these for his sample choice item earlier this month. He absolutely loves these socks and will choose it everytime it's offered in a sample choice, no matter what! The patterns may get a little crazy and excentric at times, but he doesn't care, he loves em all!</p>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>Davines - Momo Conditioner</DT>
<DD>Sample pouch, $1?</DD>
<p>This was a bonus item that they included and who can say no to bonus items. It will be great for my husband to try this with the Momo shampoo, so it's perfect.</p>
</DL>

<p><b>VERDICT:</b> This box was amazing and absolutely fit my husband's profile. The total value came up to $38.50 not including the bonus item. My husband will absolutely use every single item in this box and he says this was his favorite box from <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox">Birchbox Man</a> so far!</p>
