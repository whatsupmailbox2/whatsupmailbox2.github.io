<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="http://www.fabletics.com/invite/whatsupmailbox/">Fabletics (or FL2 for Men)</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $49.95 / month plus Free Shipping. -Not sure if the price for FL2 will be the same, but I'll keep you posted!</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> You'll receive outfits (2 or 3-piece) for your workout that you can choose and customize monthly. 
-I'm guessing it will be the same structure for FL2, I watched their sneak peek video and it looks like it's more 2-piece outfits for Men, but I'll let you know more details as soon as I get more info.</p>

<p>Current subscribers will be able to use their existing VIP membership to buy for men too.</p>

<p>I'm so excited about this launch and knew that it was only time where they'll add a Men's line to their collection. Their quality is great and price as a VIP membership is a <strike>steal</strike> deal. I can't wait to buy some workout clothes for my husband!</p>
