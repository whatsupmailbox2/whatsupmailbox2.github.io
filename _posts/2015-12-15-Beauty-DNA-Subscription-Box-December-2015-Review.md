<p>Beauty DNA is a personalized experience. They send out one full-sized product that's matched with your skin concerns or needs. When you join, there's a "Beauty Profile" (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/Beauty-DNA-August-2015-Review/" target="_blank">you can see my August review where I explain their Beauty Profile</a>) that you need to complete and this is how they match you with your product. It didn't take me long at all to complete it and I also like the fact that you can access your Beauty Profile anytime and modify it if you ever have any changes in your skincare needs.</p>

<H4>Based on my Beauty Profile, here is the item they matched me with this month:</H4>

<DT><b>PHYTO</b> Secret de Nuit Intense Hydration Regenerating Night Cream</DT>
<DD>Full Size 2.5 oz., Value $38</DD>
</DL>

<p>Okay, first off I have to admit that I'm kind of disappointed in the low value this month. Secondly, I thought they always send an extra bonus item if the value falls under $50. I read this from another blogger's review so I'm not sure if they've changed their policies lately or if they just forgot to send me an extra item. Either way, I've reached out to them via email and I'll wait to see what they say and post an update here. UPDATE: They replied with the following statement, "If the primary product match is less than or equal to retail value of $25, a second product match will be generated and to ensure the retail value of the box exceeds $25."</p>

<p>I actually love PHYTO products and have a couple of their haircare items currently that I use. The only issue I have with this leave-in treatment is that you're supposed to use it on damp hair then sleep on it. It hydrates, replenish, and helps strengthen your hair while you sleep so that you wake up to radiantly soft, supple, and manageable hair that looks healthy. I can't sleep with damp hair, I get a headache when I do. So I guess I'll be using this outside of its recommended use and apply during the day. It should work the same way, I hope.</p>

<p>Beauty DNA always includes a detailed Beauty Report about the product and why they matched it for you (me).</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Sadly this month was a miss for me. The value was low and the product was just okay. I'll still be using this and knowing it's Phyto, I'm sure it'll do great for my hair, I just wish it wasn't a night leave-in treatment. I guess it's time for me to update my Beauty Profile so that next month's match might be better (this time I'm adjusting my answers and concerns so that hopefully they'll send me a moisturizer or face serum). With that said, Beauty DNA is still a great value for me and I'm hoping next month will be a better match!</p>
