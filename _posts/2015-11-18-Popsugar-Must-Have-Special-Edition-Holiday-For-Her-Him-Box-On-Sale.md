<p>If you're interested in purchasing, I suggest buying as soon as possible as these will go fast and before you know it, it'll be sold out! That happens almost always with their Special Edition boxes. You can <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">purchase your Special Edition box here</a>, or go to their website <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">musthave.popsugar.com</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>I purchased the "Holiday For Her" and I'm SO excited, I can't wait to get my hands on it! No spoilers have been released so far, so that just adds to the excitement and suspense, but I'll be sure to let you all know if I hear something!</p>
