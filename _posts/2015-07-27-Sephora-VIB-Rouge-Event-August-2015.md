<p><H2><a href="http://www.sephora.com" target="_blank">Sephora</a> private beauty event only for VIB Rouge members!</H2></p>

<p>This event is called <b>Beauty Before Brunch</b> and in my experience from attending all past events before, they will include snacks and beverages as well. It'll most likely be pastries and coffee.</p>

<p>If you're a VIB Rouge, you should have received an email with the link to RSVP. Or you can login to your Sephora account and RSVP there (go to your VIB Rouge/Beauty Insider page). Make sure you reserve sooner than later as some locations fill up fast and once it's full you won't be able to join.</p>

<p><i class="icon-comment-alt"></i> I absolutely LOVE going to these private events, it's one of the perks of being a VIB Rouge that I enjoy the most. They close the store for this event so only invitees are allowed to enter, then you get treated extra special that day with mini makeovers and freebies. This time it'll be a cute Sephora makeup bag with deluxe-sized samples inside. And what's even more amazing is you can bring 1 friend to join you and your friend will receive this freebie as well if he/she makes a purchase, how awesome is that! I always bring a friend with me cause friends don't let other friends miss out on free stuff! ;)</p>
