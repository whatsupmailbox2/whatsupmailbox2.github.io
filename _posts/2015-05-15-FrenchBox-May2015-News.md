<p><a href="https://getfrenchbox.com">French Box</a> is a fairly new subscription that started last Fall, but it went on a brief hiatus due to restructuring. 
Their last box in February was such a flop (they included an expired skincare) that many subscribers were outraged. They tried to make it right by sending 2 additional full size items, but the damage was done. 
People lost faith and many cancelled. So it was only logical for them to step back and restructure their company in order to regain the trust of their subscribers.</p>

<H4>Here's their relaunch announcement:</H4>

<p>I'm happy that they are coming back and it seems like they've changed into a better and brighter direction (based on their changes) and let's hope that's true with their May 2015 box. I'll post my review as soon as I get my box!</p>

<p>I love everything about France. The language, the food, the country. I've been to France (most recently last fall) and getting a box monthly to remind me of the Provence or Paris "La ville de l'amour" makes me happy. 
So although they had a bit of a hiccup, I kept my subscription and am giving them another chance.</p> 

<p>I've also been in contact with them during their whole restructuring, and their customer service has been very helpful and informational, and it seems transparency is 
a priority for them now. So that's a good sign.</p>
