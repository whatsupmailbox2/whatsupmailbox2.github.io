<p>I haven't reviewed my Popsugar boxes in awhile due to the holidays, plus the fact that I end up using all the items before I even get to take pictures of them. But that will change lovelies, regular reviews will be coming your way starting from this month! =)</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Spark Joy</b> by Marie Kondo</DT>
<DD>Value $18.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>This book was revealed to be included in this month's box so I knew I was getting it and to be honest, quite excited about it too. It's an illustrated guide book to help you declutter and organize the items in your house. Such an appropriate item to include for the new year!</p>

<br>

<img src="/images/PopsugarJan2016SparkJoyMarieKondoBook2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

<p>The author, Marie Kondo, is a Japanese decluttering guru with her acclaimed KonMari Method. With step-by-step folding illustrations for everything from shirts to socks, plus guidance on specific categories such as kitchen tools, cleaning supplies, hobby goods, and digital photos. It's meant to "Spark Joy" into your life through organization. So excited to get this and can't wait to start reading and organizing!</p>

<DD>Value $22</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love this brand and their shower gels. I've received them from other subscription boxes in the past and have no complaints. Their scents are heavenly and lather well too, and can be used as a shower gel or as a bubble bath gel. I also adore the names they give to each scent, who doesn't love a scent named "Bathing with sharks (for that competitive edge in work and/or play)."</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Pehr Designs</b> Pebble Speck Bin</DT>
<DD>Value $40</DD>
</DL>

<p>OMG, I love this bin! It's big and roomy, can be folded flat again if needed for storage, and the design is pretty neutral that it will certainly fit in any decor. You can store magazines, scarves, hats or just about anything you can think of that needs to be stored. I'm so happy they included this and it ties in perfectly with the organizing theme!</p>

<DT><b>Blue Sky</b> Day Designer Weekly Planner</DT>
<DD>Value $15.99</DD>

<p>Another organizing item, well organizing your time that is. I'm currently using the planner that I received in my <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Luxor-Box-Subscription-December-2015-Special-Edition-Box-Review/" target="_blank">Luxor Box December 2015 Special Edition Box</a>, and I don't think I can use 2 planners continuously throughout the year (that's too much work!), so sadly I will have to gift this. It is quite beautiful in color and has useful pages for organizing your days, weeks and months. See pictures below.</p>

<br>

<center><a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/PopsugarJan2016BlueSkyDayDesignerWeeklyPlanner2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

<p>The first few pages asks you to set your goals for this year, your dreams and ideas about the life you want to live, and your vision of what the coming year could be. I thought that was pretty unique and helpful!</p>

<br>

<center><a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/PopsugarJan2016BlueSkyDayDesignerWeeklyPlanner3.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

<p>The weekly pages include check boxes so you can write down to-do lists as well, how thoughtful.</p>

<br>

<center><a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/PopsugarJan2016BlueSkyDayDesignerWeeklyPlanner4.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

<p>The monthly pages are roomy enough for you to write down important events and they also state the holidays in the appropriate dates (with a green tag on it too!).</p>

<p>I think this is another great item to be included in this month's box. I'm just sad that I already have a planner that I'm using right now or else I would have used this.</p> 

<br>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Patchology</b> FlashMasque Trio</DT>
<DD>3 Masks, Value $20</DD>
</DL>

<p>Yes! A set of face masks! My face has been going through some flares lately, probably due to the junk I ate during the holidays (too much chocolate) so it needs some care and loving. So these face masks came just in time to the rescue.</p>

<p>This set includes 1 Facial Sheet each of their Exfoliate, Hydrate and Illuminate masks. I will be using them in exactly that order. I'll exfoliate one day, then hydrate the next day, and finish off with illuminate the day after that. With that plan of care, hopefully my skin will once again be normal. Fingers crossed.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Project 7, Inc</b> Summer Snow Sugar Free Gum</DT>
<DD>Value $1.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I like how the package is resealable, keeps them gums fresh and crunchy. I also love that the company contributes to a greater cause and mission, giving back to 7 areas of need; Save the Earth, House the Homeless, Feed the Hungry, Quench the Thirsty, Heal the Sick, Teach them Well, and Hope for Peace. Hence the name Project 7.</p> 

<p>With every 7th pack of this particular flavor Summer Snow, Project 7 will donate to support anti-bullying programs in the USA.</p>

<br>

<img src="/images/PopsugarJan2016Project7SummerSnowGum2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

<p>These little gums taste amazing, it's sweet but not overly and in a good way. I tasted one and it was so good that I just had to pop another one in. I think I'll need to buy more soon! FYI, they have them in Target.</p>

<br>

<H4><i class="icon-gift"></i> Bonus item:</H4>

<DL>
<DT><b>ChapStick</b> Total Hydration 100% Natural Soothing Vanilla</DT>
<DD>Value $2.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I can't even remember the last time I used an actual ChapStick. Maybe highschool? They've really come a long way from the way it looked like back then. Now the packaging is all grown up and got a bump of chicness with its silver case, quite impressed.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> What a great box to start the year with! It was a good theme for the new year and I think they nailed the items to represent that well. I especially loved the Storage Bin and the Organizing Book, definitely my favorite 2 items out of the whole box. The total value came up to $121.96 and I'm super happy with that too. That's triple the cost of this box, hurray! Next month is Valentine's Day so I'm really hoping for some lovely items to celebrate that with. No spoilers have been released yet even though we're coming towards the end of January. Hopefully soon and I'll be sure to keep you posted!</p>
