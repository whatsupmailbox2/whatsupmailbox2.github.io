<DT><a href="http://www.coastalscents.com/natural-products/butter/bw-002.html" target="_blank">Coastal Scents Unrefined Shea Butter</a></DT>
<DD>2 sample jars, .2oz each, Value $.50 cents?</DD>
</DL>

<p>This Unrefined Shea Butter is 100% natural and is targeted to moisturize dry skin. Some reviews said that the smell is bad, but I didn't find that true at all, at least with my 2 samples. They smell like shea butter, period. I'm happy that they included 2, but a full sized product would have been more appreciated, especially since the value is low and I purchased the Plus Box, just saying.</p>

<DD>0.8 oz bag, Value $1?</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love popchips and they're one of my favorite snacks so I was happy to get this in the box, yum! I've never tried the veggie chips though, but if you've ever had the veggie chips from Trader Joe's, it tastes pretty similar. Don't let the name fool you though, it's still made from dried potatoes. And the veggie part? Well it's in the form of beet powder, spinach powder, tomato powder, kale powder... you get the whole drill. So don't let that fool you from thinking, "this is so healthy I can eat the whole bag!"</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.amazon.com/STRONG-KIND-Roasted-Jalapeno-Ounce/dp/B00JA9LDH6" target="_blank">STRONG & KIND Roasted Jalapeno Bar</a></DT>
<DD>1.6 Ounce, Value $1.2</DD>
</DL>

<p>I was so excited when I saw this bar in the box. I love everything spicy and to finally see a protein bar that is both savory and spicy, how perfect! I couldn't help but to try it right away. This bar is definitely savory and so good too! There might be some heat from the jalapenos, but very slightly (or none for me at all, I'm used to spicy). The ingredients are: almonds, pumpkin and hemp seeds, honey, non-GMO glucose, and pea crisps, jalapeno chili, onion powder, garlic powder, smoked sea salt and sunflower lecithin. The nuts and seeds are completely whole, not mashed like some other bars and because of that I can see the ingredients in whole with nothing hidden, that's a big plus in my book. I've found a new favorite protein bar!</p>

<DD>1 pouch 6 fl.oz., Value $.96</DD>
</DL>

<p>Right off the bat I noticed that the juice is from concentrate which is not my favorite type. Plus I think it's quite odd to add a juice pack into a sub box. I mean a bottle maybe, and something that's new and healthy, but a juice pack? I feel like a kid again with a lunch box.</p>

<DD>1 sample vial, 4ml/.13 fl.oz., Value $.65</DD>
</DL>

<p>I was introduced to Poo-Pourri 3 years ago and it's a must for our house, when we travel, and in my purse! It really does what it's supposed to do and the scents I've had so far are amazing. All you gotta do is spray some in the throne prior to no.2, and voila, no stink at all. Plus it's all natural so you can breathe, freely. I absolutely love their titles too, and the poetry that goes on every bottle, hillarious! For example, here's the one for the Original scent: "spritz the bowl before-you-go and no one else will ever know!" You gotta check them out and if you've never tried them, I totally recommend it.</p>

<DD>2 bottles at 2 fl.oz. each, Value $6.48</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm not an energy drink consumer but this one is made with natural ingredients such as Ginger root, Ginseng, Black Elderberry Berries, and Green tea to name a few. It's also 99.9% caffeine free for those of you who are like me and are sensitive to caffeine. My two bottles have an expiration date that is next month, so I guess I'll be trying this soon.</p>

<DT><a href="http://egyptianmagic.com" target="_blank">Egyptian Magic All Purpose Skin Cream</a></DT>
<DD>Value $.50?</DD>
</DL>

<p>Oh how I dislike receiving foil packets in sub boxes. It just makes the box seem cheap and desperate and I'm a high maintenance gal that wants to be wowed and pampered. Especially when money has been spent. So no, this did not make me happy. That aside, this product is actually available on <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> and got great reviews. I myself found it to be a bit greasy for my taste, but that's just me. The packets says to rub a moderate amount in your palms until it takes the form of oil, then apply on your skin.</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1711" target="_blank">Nordic Naturals - Omega Boost in Creamy Lemon</a></DT>
<DD>Value $.50?</DD>
</DL>

<p>I grew up having to take fish oil as my parents believed it to be the magic elixir that will make you smart and healthy, mostly smart though. I wish they had this when I was younger, this tastes much better than fish oil. I'm not sure I'd be diligent enough to take this everyday though.</p> 

<DL>
<DT><a href="https://www.vibranthealth.com/super-natural-calcium/product-pages/super-natural-calcium" target="_blank">Vibrant Health - Super Natural Calcium</a></DT>
<DD>Value $.50?</DD>
</DL>

<p>So this is in powder form and you're supposed to mix it into your beverage or food of choice. I feel as though there are more convenient ways to take your daily needed calcium. Powder just seems too complicated to do in my busy mornings that I'll just end up forgetting or skipping it altogether. They do have this in tablet form if you're interested.</p>

<DT><a href="https://www.snapsupercandy.com/store/#BEAN" target="_blank">Snap Infusion - Supercandy in Bean flavored</a></DT>
<DD>Value $2</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've tried this in last month's Popsugar Must Have and they were good. This serves as a quick snack and is made from natural ingredients with functional benefits. I'm not sure about "Bean flavored" though, seems like an odd flavor to have.</p>

<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.emeraldbrand.com/facial-tissue/" target="_blank">Emerald Brand - Facial Tissue Pack</a></DT>
<DD>Value $.47</DD>
</DL>

<p>These tissues are soft and made with bagasse and bamboo, so no trees here! I have bamboo sheets and they are amazing so I'm happy to try bamboo tissues. I just might have to buy some more!</p>

<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.lakanto.com/products/lakanto-classic-individual-packs/" target="_blank">Lakanto Classic Sweeteners</a></DT>
<DD>2 sample packets, Value $.50?</DD>
</DL>

<p>Sugar packets, really? Sigh. I'm not sure I can write more on how disappointed I am on these sample packets plus they're tiny. I'll still try it since it's Vegan, 100% Sugar Free, Gluten Free and Non-GMO but tastes just like sugar.</p> 

<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.florahealth.com/product_conditions_usa.cfm?conditions_id=6&prod_id=295" target="_blank">Flora - Enzyme Blend</a></DT>
<DD>A packet of 3 capsules, Value $.10?</DD>
</DL>

<p>This is a dietary supplement that consist of 7 enzymes including lactase, which breaks down lactose and supports the relief of discomforts associated with dairy intolerance, plus protease to aid in the digestion of proteins. It also contains the enzymes required to break down and metabolize fat, carbs, soluble fiber, starch, milk sugar, and complex sugars. And in addition to that, it also helps to reduce gas and bloating following meals rich in carbs.</p>
<p>Being a woman, we have those days where we wake up all puffy and feeling fat due to bloating, and this might be great for that. I also feel that constipation happens more frequently when I'm traveling because of the difference in food and ingredients each country offers, so I'll totally be taking this with me when I'm going on my vacation later this week. I'm hoping it'll help and if it does, it just might be a staple in our medicine cabinet.</p>

<center><img src='/images/ConsciousBoxJune2015Vaska.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><a href="http://vaskahome.com/products/" target="_blank">Vaska - Detergent and Dishwasher tablets</a></DT>
<DD>1 tablet each, Value $1?</DD>
</DL>

<p>I currently use <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=E8Cf336JUvc&offerid=281968.138&type=3&subid=0&LSNSUBSITE=adgid" target="_blank">Honest Co.</a> products for my detergent and dishwasher so I'm curious to see if these can compare. The dishwasher tablet contains no phosphates or chlorine and promises to clean your dishes naturally without compromise. The detergent claims to leave no stains, residue, toxins, irritants, pollutant or chemicals. Neither in your clothes or environment.</p> 
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I don't know yet how I fully feel about this box. I'm disappointed in the many sample packets that's included, and I'm not sure I find the full sized items which I assume to be the protein bar and energy drink to be satisfactory for a Plus Box. At $19.99 a month and the promise of full-sized items, this was a complete fail and the total value of all the items were $16.36 based on my calculations of the samples. That falls short of the subscription price. Although I do tend to keep a healthy and natural home, I think I'd rather spend my money on actual products rather than samples which I won't fully be able to assess due to the size. Sadly I don't think this box is for me. I just can't justify spending money on items that I could get free by visiting my local Whole Foods or Sprouts. They give out free samples frequently and in large amounts, at least mine does. If you're looking to find new and healthy products to try for your home, health or beauty, and don't mind trying it in small samples form, then perhaps this box might be for you. But I wouldn't advise getting the Plus Box as the cost versus value is way off in my opinion.</p>

<p>If you want to try them out, you can get your first box FREE by <a href="http://shop.pe/v3T5B" target="_blank"><big>joining here</big></a> and using coupon code <a href="http://fivefourclub.7eer.net/c/164125/122548/2570" target="_blank"><b>FRIENDFREE</b></a>, you only need to pay $6.95 shipping.</p>
