<p>Just saw this today and was super excited about my discovery that I just had to share it with all you beauties! Now you can get your hands on one of these gorgeous clutches without having to fly to Paris (like I did). You don't even have to be a member to be able to purchase them, just go to their website <a href="http://ouipleasebox.com" target="_blank">www.ouipleasebox.com</a> and then go to their OUISHOP section.</p>

<p>The X-Large sizes are $100 and the Large sizes are $90. The price is awesome too and on point with their current euro prices so I'd suggest grabbing one of these lux clutches before they get sold out!</p>

<p>Happy shopping lovelies!</p>
