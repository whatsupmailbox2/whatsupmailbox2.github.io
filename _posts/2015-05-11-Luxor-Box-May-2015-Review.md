I love the tifanny blue color of the box, it already screams luxury to me. And they definitely paid attention to the packaging details -I think the sleeve on the box adds that extra touch of luxury.

![Luxor Box May 2015 Lisa Stewart2](/images/LuxorBoxMay2015LisaStewart2.jpg)
<a href="https://www.lisastewartonline.com/collections/bar-none-stud-earrings/">Lisa Stewart Bar None Stud Earrings</a> $85
<p>This was one of the items they revealed earlier last month. They didn't actually say what the item was, only that it was a jewelry piece from Lisa Stewart, so I was hoping for a necklace. I'm not sure how I feel about these earrings but maybe they'll grow on me as I wear them. It's made of sterling silver vermeil, 14k gold plated with genuine cubic zirconia stones.</p>

<a href="http://www.mariposa-gift.com/p-1883-triple-pearls-tea-light.aspx?Eid=281">Mariposa Tea Light - Triple Pearls Tea Light</a> $25.
<p>This tea light is gorgeous and fits perfectly with my style and decor. It's made with 100% recycled materials (Recycled Sandcast Aluminum) and is made in Mexico.</p>

![Luxor Box May 2015 RCK](/images/LuxorBoxMay2015RCK.jpg)
<a href="http://www.redcarpetkolour.com/order_rck.html">Red Carper Kolour Body Glow in Medium</a> - FULL SIZE! $49.95
<p>This was their second spoiler that they sent last month as well. They didn't mention the brand, but teased that it <i>"was developed by an expert that works with the Hollywood stars. This product has become a Red Carpet favorite!"</i> I'm not sure if everyone got this in Medium, but I'm sure glad I did because it suits my skintone.</p>

![Luxor Box May 2015 MSC](/images/LuxorBoxMay2015MSC.jpg)
<a href="https://www.mscskincare.com/product/vanilla-exfoliating-sugar-scrub/">MSC Skin Care - Vanilla Exfoliating Sugar Scrub</a> - FULL SIZE! $33
<p>Sugar scrubs are a staple in my skincare, both face and body, so I'm happy to have more. The vanilla scent is on the lighter side and I'm thankful for that -I'm not too keen on sweet fragrance. Upon reading their website, it says that their vanilla is infused in-house with imported Madagascar vanilla beans. I can't wait to use this!</p>

![Luxor Box May 2015 MSC Set2](/images/LuxorBoxMay2015MSCSet2.jpg)
<a href="https://www.mscskincare.com/product/lavender-and-bergamot-body-nectar/">MSC Skin Care - Lavender and Bergamot Body Nectar</a> - FULL SIZE! $30
<blockquote>Designed for daily moisturization, Body Nectars are the best body oils for the face, hair, nails, and body. Lavender and Bergamot is an uplifting blend of lavender essential oil and bergamot essential oil both which help tone skin and calm flyaway hair.</blockquote>
<p>This thing is like a spa in a bottle. You open it and immediately smell the lavender. The bottle is quite big too so it will last me a long time. So far I'm loving MSC Skin Care and I will definitely be using their coupon to purchase more items.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mscskincare.com/product/lavender-and-spearmint-lip-cream/">MSC Skin Care - Lavender and Spearmint Lip Cream</a> - FULL SIZE! $7</p>
<blockquote>Creamy, moisturizing, and vegan, too! Our lip cremes contain nourishing oils like Sunflower and Apricot Kernel combined with vitamin-rich sunflower wax helps keep your lips moisturized all day long. Our fresh lip balms are super moisturizing, and are great lip balms for men, too!</blockquote>
<p>The smell of this lip balm is so refreshing, it's like a spa for your lips! You definitely smell both the Lavender and Spearmint right off the bat. I put some on my lips as I started writing this review minutes ago and noticed my lips are all moisturized now. When I first put it on it gave a very slight tingly feeling due to the spearmint oil, but subsided soon after.</p>

![Luxor Box May 2015 Sucre](/images/LuxorBoxMay2015Sucre.jpg)
<a href="http://www.chambredesucre.com/products/his-hers-limited-edition-box">Chambre De Sucre Sugar Balls - His & Hers Set</a> - FULL SIZE! $26

<p>This two piece set features their Colored Sugar Balls and our Coffee Sugar Balls. The Colored Sugar Balls come in a mixed paster selection of pink, green, yellow and white -there's no difference in taste though. It's made with pure can sugar. The Coffee Sugar Balls are made with dark brown sugar and has no coffee flavor.</p>

<p>I've actually tried their fancy sugars before and absolutely love them! I feel so fancy and proper when I use these for my tea. And I think the name of the set is perfect and would be great for gifting a newlywed or couples who love tea/coffee.</p>

<p><b>VERDICT:</b> I absolutely LOVED their first box and thought that they curated the items pretty spot on. The total value came up to $255.95 which is double the actual cost! I'll be using every single item in this box, and the value is definitely there for me so I'm satisfied and will continue to subscribe. I can't wait to see what their second box will offer!</p>
