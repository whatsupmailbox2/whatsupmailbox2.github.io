<p>Ipsy always ships their bags in bright neon pink padded envelopes, it's hard to miss it in your mailbox!</p>

<p>Ipsy is very similar to <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependent on the answers you give in the Ipsy beauty quiz. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items. And you can retake the beauty quiz at anytime if you feel that the products didn't really match you.</p>

<p>This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.</p>

<br>

<p>Every month <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/referralGift/r/uns8d?cid=s_gift&sid=copy" target="_blank">Ipsy</a> sends their items in makeup bags with an exclusive design. This month's design is festive red with a diamond pattern stitching and glossy finish. It's nice and simple, not my favorite but will still be used.</p>

<p>This month's Info Card states the theme which is "with love from ipsy" and includes chariactures of all the <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/referralGift/r/uns8d?cid=s_gift&sid=copy" target="_blank">Ipsy</a> girls, so cute!</p>
<br>

<H4>And here are my items:</H4>

<p>I feel like I hit the jackpot everytime I get a beauty tool in my Ipsy bag, I really do. Although the name of the brand made me believe it was a French brand, it's actually founded by a husband and wife team in Tampa, Florida and they still reside there. They're all about making quality brushes at an affordable price.</p>

<br>

<p>The brush has a good length (approx. 6.5"), longer than my other concealer brushes which I actually like as it gives me the option of either holding it closer for a more precise application, or holding it further away for a softer look.</p>

<br>

<p>The bristles are soft and work great with my concealer. No complaints here!</p>

<p>I love Tarte and use a lot of their products so I was happy to receive this. I've never used their finishing powder before, but I do love their Amazonian Clay line, so I'm sure this will be great for my skin. Fyi, Amazonian Clay is known to remove surface oil and mattify skin, nourish all skin types and give skin an overall smooth and even appearance. Can't wait to try this out!</p>

<p>Subscribers who received this lipstick in their Glam Bag will receive either Nudie Red, Sweet One, or Tender Heart. Mine is Tender Heart, which I would say is a brownish pink nude color that will go great for everyday wear.</p>

<p>How cute is that! I opened the box and I'm greeted with a friendly message. Good choice indeed.</p>

<p>I love how this color looks on my lips. It has a satin finish and is creamy, highly-pigmented, and moisturizing too. This lipstick is 100% vegan, and even the tube is fully recyclable! I really like this.</p>

<DD>Full Size 1 oz., Value $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>I can't believe I got a full-sized product that's valued at $25 in my Ipsy bag, how awesome. Scrubs are a must in my skincare, especially here in California where the weather is dry and my skin reacts to it. I'm already using a scrub from a different brand for my lips, so I can't wait to try this one out too. Their product page says that it will make your lips and hands feel silky, smooth, nourished and hydrated. And best part yet, the ingredients are all-natural. It's 100% vegan, paraben-free and made with natural sugar, natural flavors and vitamin E fortified nutrient dense oils.</p>

<DT><b>Marc Anthony Hair Care</b> Coconut Oil & Shea Butter Deep Conditioning Treatment</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 50ml, Value $2.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I actually needed a hair treatment so I tried this out right away. I didn't really notice any difference in my hair afterwards, both in dryness and softness. It doesn't compare at all to other deep conditioning treatments I've used in the past. It's also heavy on the coconut scent, which is not my favorite. So in summary, this was a miss for me.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Minus the hair treatment, I loved this month's items. With 3 full-sized products and a Tarte Cosmetics item, I'm more than happy. The total value came up to $63.99 which is pretty high and totally amazing for its $10 cost. That's what I love so much about <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/referralGift/r/uns8d?cid=s_gift&sid=copy" target="_blank">Ipsy</a>, their monthly cost is just the same as <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a>, but they tend to send more full-sized products and have a higher value, plus a makeup bag too! Can't recommend them enough!</p>
