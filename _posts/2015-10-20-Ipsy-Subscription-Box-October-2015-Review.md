<p>Ipsy always ships their bags in bright neon pink padded envelopes, I always get excited when I see it in my mailbox!</p>

<p>Ipsy is very similar to Birchbox where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependent on the answers you give in the Ipsy beauty quiz. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items. And you can retake the beauty quiz at anytime if you feel that the products didn't really match you.</p>

<p>This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.</p>

<p>Every month Ipsy sends their items in makeup bags that they produce exclusively. September's theme is "Alter Ego" ahence the variety in color on both sides, one is black and the other side is gold. To be honest, the whole design and material is kind of blah to me, it feels a bit cheap, but that's just me.</p>

<p>They also include a card noting the theme for the month and in the back is a short note from them and as always, a chance to win one-year of Glam Bag subscription.</p>
<br>

<H4>And here are my items:</H4>

<p>I'm a fan of Dr.Brandt products but never used this one in particular so I was happy to receive this and can't wait to try it out! This product will help to diminish the appearance of fine lines, acne marks and skin discolorations.</p>

<p>Although I typically get super happy when I see beauty tools in my Ipsy bags, this one was not one to be excited about. I can always use another tweezer, that wasn't the issue. The disappointment lies on the quality of the tweezer itself. See the picture below.</p>

</a></center>

<p>As you can see for yourself, really poorly made that even the branding itself is already coming off and it's hard to see from the picture, but the actual tip is not even and it wasn't very sharp as well. It's so bad that I don't think I can gift this to anyone. What a bummer, what's going on Ipsy?! I definitely would not have paid $25 for this!</p>

<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 5ml, Value $12</DD>

<p>Although I've been quite open to trying out new fragrances lately, this one is too sweet for me. I do love the taste of vanilla, just not on my perfume. The size itself is pretty decent and would be great for travelling or to include in a small purse. I'm sure I know someone who'll love this, so off it goes to that lucky person.</p>

<DD>Full Size 0.14 oz., Value $14.95</DD>

<p>This eye shadow is full-sized so that's already a good sign. But unfortunately the color does not work well for me, I wished it did though.</p>

<p>The color is shimmery and application is creamy. It's also free of preservatives, chemicals, dyes, talc, oils, and other fillers.</p>

<DD>Sample Size 0.04 fl.oz., Value $3</DD>
</DL>

<p>I like The Balm Cosmetics and I've tried their lip products before thanks to other subscriptions. I actually prefer the matte look for my lips since it looks more natural, so I was happy that this liquid lipstick does just that. The color is a pinky nude color (again, perfect for a natural look) and it has a vanilla mint taste and scent.</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Sadly this month was a miss for me. The bag was blah and so was most of the items. As much as I hate to admit it, I think this is the worst bag I've received from them as of yet. The only items I'll be using is the Dr. Brandt microdermabrasion and The Balm lipstick, but $10 for those two samples is no good, not at all. Even though the actual total value seems high, it's mostly because the tweezers that were poorly made has a value of $25, so I wouldn't really look into value versus cost for this month's bag. I've updated my beauty profile since receiving this bag so hopefully next month's items will be better. I'm really hoping, if not, Houston we've got a problem!</p>
