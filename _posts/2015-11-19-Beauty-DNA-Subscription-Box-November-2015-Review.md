<p>Second look at unboxing reveals that I received a skin product! (It says Skin Report on the top right)</p>
<br>

<p>Beauty DNA is a personalized experience. They send out one full-sized product that's matched with your skin concerns or needs. When you join, there's a "Beauty Profile" (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/Beauty-DNA-August-2015-Review/" target="_blank">you can see my August review where I explain their Beauty Profile</a>) that you need to complete and this is how they match you with your product. It didn't take me long at all to complete it and I also like the fact that you can access your Beauty Profile anytime and modify it if you ever have any changes in your skincare needs.</p>

<H4>Based on my Beauty Profile, here is the item they matched me with:</H4>

<DD>Full Size 60 ml, Value $90</DD>
</DL>

<p>First off I was amazed at the value received this month. Secondly, my day moisturizer doesn't have SPF in it, so this was definitely much appreciated.</p>

<p>This moisturizer is designed to treat anti-aging and dry skin. It's non-comedogenic and light in texture. It absorbed quickly and left no residue which means it will be great as a pre-makeup base.</p>

<p>Here's another look at the moisturizer opened, as you can see it's sealed for extra protection:</p>

<p>Beauty DNA always includes a detailed Beauty Report about the product and why they matched it for you (me).</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Not only did I get a great day moisturizer that has SPF, but it also had a high value! At $90, it's almost quadrupple the $25 cost, amazing. Beauty DNA is a great subscription to sign up to if you're a skincare addict and love trying out new products that are full-sized. Your skin deserves the best, and why not save money while you're at it ;)</p>
