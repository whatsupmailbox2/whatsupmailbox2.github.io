<p>SELECTED by Harrison Blake is a men's accessories monthly subscription that features products made by their brand. I love subscription boxes that tailor to men. Sure there are quite a few of them out there, but the options are still quite limited when compared to subscriptions catered to women. So when they reached out to me for a review, I was more than happy to oblige!</p>

<br>

<p>With every box that they send, they also include a business-card-like info card that details the items and prices.</p>

<br>

<H4>And here are the items for November 2015:</H4>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeNov2015Items.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="SELECTED by Harrison Blake November 2015 Items" /></center>

<p>Looking at the items, I see a nautical/sailing theme going on, love it.</p>

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeNov2015RosetteLapelPin.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Rosette Lapel Pin" /></center>

<DL>
<DT>Rosette Lapel Pin</DT>
<DD>Value $15</DD>
</DL>

<p>This lapel pin is both cute and classy. It'll go great for both a casual social event, as well as a more formal one. And red will of course go with everything, but especially well as we enter the holidays.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeNov2015PocketSquare.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Microfiber Pocket Square" /></center>

<DL>
<DT>Microfiber Pocket Square</DT>
<DD>Value $18</DD>
</DL>

<p>Pocket squares always add that pizzaz to your outfit. And even if you (or the man in your life) don't like to accessorize, the minimal a man should do is add pocket squares. You can skip the lapels, skip the cuff links, but do please add a pocket square.</p>

<p>This pocket square has a different color on the backside, so it's almost like getting two-in-one!</p>

<br>

<p>The backside reveals a red color that is both festive and bright.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeNov2015KnitTie.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Knit Necktie" /></center>

<DL>
<DT>Knit Necktie</DT>
<DD>Value $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've been wanting to get my husband a knit necktie! Both the unique texture and shape appeals to me and thankfully, my husband too. He singled out this item immediately and can't wait to wear it!</p>

<br>

<p>This is a well made necktie and the design can be both contemporary or classy at the same time. This has got to be my favorite item in the box!</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeNov2015GoldAnchorTieBar.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Gold Anchor Tie Bar" /></center>

<DL>
<DT>Gold Anchor Tie Bar</DT>
<DD>Value $24</DD>
</DL>

<p>This tie bar fits perfectly with the nautical theme (I wonder why) and goes indescreetly well with the knit necktie above. Wearing this tie bar with a dark colored necktie will showcase the nautical shape and gold color more prominently, if that's what you're going for. Either way you go, your tie will stay in place for your perfect well-groomed look.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeNov2015AnchorBracelet.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Leather Anchor Bracelet" /></center>

<DL>
<DT>Leather Anchor Bracelet</DT>
<DD>Value $12</DD>
</DL>

<p>A bracelet to match your tie bar, yes please. It's made of braided red leather and finished off with a brass anchor.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/HarrisonBlakeNov2015CollarStay.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Stainless Steel Collar Stay" /></center>

<DL>
<DT>Stainless Steel Collar Stay</DT>
<DD>Value $20</DD>
</DL>

<p>If you're frustrated with your collar's curling tendencies, it may be time for you to invest in some collar stays. And what better ones than one that's made of stainless steel with a magnetic tab to keep it in place. This is a must have!</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I'm so glad I got to review this box, it had a great mix of quality accessories for men and the style is on par with current trends. This month's theme was nautical and everything goes perfectly well together, but you can of course wear them separately. The total value of the box came up to $114 which is quite incredible for a $25 box. Keep in mind that prices are their stated values and some of the items are exclusive to the box. If you're into accessorizing or would like to expand and perfect your dapper style, this would be a great subscription to try!</p>
