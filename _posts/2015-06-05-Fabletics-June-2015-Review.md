<DT>Moorea Bra in <i>Black/White</i></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $34.95, VIP Member Price $24.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>This bra is so sporty yet sexy! I can see myself wearing this not only to the gym but everyday. I even saw Kate Hudson wear this top at a Fabletics party this week! She paired it with a black maxi skirt, so uber chic.</p>
<p>This top has a built-in bra with removable cups which is convenient, and the fabric feels soft and breathable. Sizing was perfect as I didn't need to size up or down.</p>

<DT>Salar Crop in <i>Seashell Bloom Print</i></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $64.95, VIP Member Price $44.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>This print is so pretty! It also comes in a blue theme color with the same print, but my skin tone doesn't match that type of blue so I opted for this color instead. I have Salar Crops from them already and they're great. Comfortable fit with no camel toes or signs of your undies, plus a waistband that helps to eliminate muffin top.</p>

<br>

<p><b>My Thoughts:</b> I'm so happy with my outfit, it looks amazing and comfortable at the same time. The crop print is gorgeous, and the top, well it's so versatile that its a win for me. The total value of the outfit came up to $99.90 in retail value, and with VIP membership pricing it goes down to $69.90. But since I have their subscription, I only paid $59.95 and that's a <strike>deal</strike> steal!</p>
