<p>Glossybox ships on the 3rd or 4th week of the month.</p>

<p>They package their boxes inside of another box for shipping purposes, makes the products extra protected and feels more luxurious to open =)</p>

<p>I love their pretty pink boxes! And since one of my favorite colors is pink, it's no surprise that I collect them and use it to store my beauty treasures.</p>

<DD>Full Size .9g/0.03oz, Value $10</DD>
</DL>

<p>This eyeliner goes on smooth, has a matte finish and the color is very pigmented. It also has a built-in smudger that will allow you to easily blend the color, great for a smokey eye look!</p>

<DD>Full Size .5 fl oz / 15 ml, Value $12</DD>
</DL>

<p>SpaRitual nail polishes are vegan and formulated without DBP, toulene, formaldehyde and formaldehyde resin. I have some nail polishes by them already and am a huge fan, so I was super happy when I saw this in the box!</p>

<p>There are different colors that subscribers receive and I got the color Arroyo which is a Sandy Matte Shimmer color, and it really is matte. I love both the color and that it's matte, but if you don't, just put on a regular top coat and it'll make the color glossy.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of the shade on me:</p>

<center><img src='/images/GlossyboxAugust2015NailPolish2.jpg'></center>
<p>The shade looks quite natural with pink undertones. The picture doesn't really show it, but it really is matte with some shimmer. Love it!</p>

<DD>Full Size 4g, Value $24</DD>
</DL>

<p>This lash primer creates volume and is developed to nourish and enhance lashes, while creating a base coat that enhances your mascara's effects. It can be worn alone at night as a conditioner too. I've used lash primers from other brands before, so I'm happy I received one in this box and will surely be using this.</p>

<DD>Travel Size 1oz/30g, Value $7.80</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've been a fan of Glamglow and have been using their masks religously for the past few years. So when they came out with a cleanser this year, I just had to try it and instantly fell in love. It's just as good as their masks! Needless to say, I was again ecstatic when I saw this was included in the box.</p>

<p>This cleanser transforms from mud into a foaming lather and it will gently exfoliate and cleanse your skin to create a more youthful-looking, glowing complexion. Formulated with Brazilian superfruits acai, guarana, and acerola, it provides potent antioxidants. Safe to use everyday even on my sensitive skin, and I find great results in keeping blemishes away. So glad I have this in travel size!</p>

<DD>Full Size 10ml/0.33 fl.oz, Value $4.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>I believe there are two variations of this lip balm and I received Délicieuse. This lip balm goes on clear and has a sweet scent of vanilla. It's rich and oily so it applies smooth and glossy (like applying Vaseline to your lips). Its formula is enriched with Tepescohuite extract, a Mexican plant known for its regenerative capabilities, and macadamia nut oil so chapped lips are healed fast! It also has anti-oxidant vitamin E that protects against damage from UV rays and pollution. And important fact, it's also paraben free.</p>

<p>So far I'm loving this lip balm. I woke up with chapped lips today so I put this product to test and it did soothe and moisturize it almost instantly. Great product and the fact that it's made in France, well that's just perfect.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I absolutely loved this month's items, every single one of them! That's major for me and I couldn't be happier about signing up with them again. The brands and products that they featured are up to my standards and fit my beauty needs, no complaints here. And 4 out of 5 items were full-sized which is AH-Mazing! I can't rave enough about this month's box ;)</p>
