<p>I was actually going to purchase this book on my Kindle, so glad I waited! I read her first book "Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns)" and absolutely loved it. She's funny, smart and such a girly girl, it's so fun reading anything that comes out of her creative mind!</p>

<p>And just in case you missed my previous post about the theme for October's box, here it is again:</p>
