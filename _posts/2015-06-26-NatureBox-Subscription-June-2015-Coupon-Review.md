# My Snacks:

<center><img src='/images/NatureBoxJune2015Items.jpg'></center>
<p>Look at all that yummy goodness and such interesting flavors too!</p>

## Items in detail:
<center><img src='/images/NatureBoxJune2015Guacamole.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT>Guacamole Bites</DT>
<DD>Net Wt. 5.1 oz</DD>
</DL>
<p>These are guacamole-flavored corn sticks and as soon as I took my first bite, I could taste lime right off the bat. So naturally I looked into the ingredients and yep, it's made with corn, spinach, garlic powder, avocado flavor, parsley and LIME! It gives a zesty kick to this corn snack and I like it.</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/NatureBoxJune2015Cashews.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT>Sriracha Roasted Cashews</DT>
<DD>Net Wt. 4 oz</DD>
</DL>
<p>I love everything and anything that's with Sriracha so it was an easy decision to include this for this month's box. The cashews are generously coated and flavored as you can see from the picture, and they taste great! Slight sweet and in my opinion not spicy at all, so it'll be safe enough to eat even for those who are not into spicy food.</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/NatureBoxJune2015Pretzels.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT>Kung Pao Pretzels</DT>
<DD>Net Wt. 4 oz</DD>
</DL>
<p>Wow, these pretzels are amazing. I can never go back to plain pretzels again! They taste exactly like kung pao flavor from the famous chinese dish, and since that's one of my husband's favorite dish, I have the urge to hide this from him and keep it all to myself =P</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I loved all my 3 snack choices this month and it'll be hard to try anything else that can top this. Everything was so tasty and I can feel somewhat better knowing that I'm snacking on healthy(er) snacks. Each package had a good amount in them and the bag is resealable making it travel friendly. Paying $13.99 for all three of these snacks is totally acceptable, especially since the flavors are pretty unique. I'm glad I subscribed and I'm already planning next month's box -it'll be a mix of sweet and savory. Stay tuned!</p>
