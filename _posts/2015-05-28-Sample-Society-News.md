<p><a href="http://www.beautybar.com/sample-society"><b>Sample Society</b></a> is a $15/month beauty subscription that I actually cancelled a few months back. The value was just not there for me and the curations were poor and did not fit me at all.</p>

<p>I'm happy to hear that they will be going in a new direction and it will exclusively be managed by Allure, so here's hoping that this time around it will be better.</p>

<p>I'm curious to see what this new change will offer, so I've resubscribed and will post the review as soon as I receive the new Allure Beauty Box in July. Stay tuned!</p>
