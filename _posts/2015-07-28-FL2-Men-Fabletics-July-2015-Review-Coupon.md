<p>Items always come individually packed.</p>

<p>Every month you get to choose your outfit from a selection that they have. New outfits are released on the 1st of every month and by purchasing outfits, you get to save money as well versus buying them individually.</p>

<p><DT>My husband chose the <big>Rio Grande</big> outfit this month.</DT></p>

<p>This is how it looks like on the model.</p>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>
<p><center><img src='/images/FL2July2015Shirt.jpg'></center></p>
<DL>
<DT>Mariner Tee in <i>Black</i></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $44.95, VIP Member Price $34.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>This shirt has a baseball tee type of style where the sleeves are just slightly longer than regular short sleeves type. It's also stated as a relaxed fit, but my husband still chose his regular Medium size and it wasn't too baggy for him. Slightly fitted but with room if that makes sense.</p>
<p>He did mention that after wearing this shirt for 3 hours straight playing racquetball, it felt quite warm so I would recommend wearing this shirt in cooler weather versus during the hot summer heat.</p>
<br>

<DL>
<DT>Freeport Short in <i>Dark Sage/Grey Heather</i></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $64.95, VIP Member Price $49.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>These shorts are pretty cool, plus it has a liner which is a must for my husband. The waistband has a two material type of look so it gives these shorts a unique look and style. There's also a back pocket that's zippered so he can put his wallet or money holder and feel safe that it won't fall out. Great item!</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Every outfit my husband picked so far has been a hit and although the shirt this month was a bit too warm for his athletic needs, it was still comfortable and will be put to better use during fall/winter. The first of the month has now become an exciting time for us since that's when we both get to choose our Fabletics/FL2 outfits lol.</p>
