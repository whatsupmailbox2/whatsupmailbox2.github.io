<p>I have been waiting forever for this box to arrive so I was beyond ecstatic when I finally saw this big beautiful black box on my doorstep!</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPleaseVol16Package.jpg'></center>
<p><i class="icon-dropbox"></i> Oui Please used to ship their boxes through FedEx Ground, but now have switched over to UPS Ground and it only took 3 days for me to receive it.</p>
<br>

<p>At first glance, you see a big cardstock sign with a French statement. They send one with every box and I collect them all to frame. It's a simple yet chic way to decorate any wall.</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPleaseVol16OpenPackage2.jpg'></center>
<p>Then you see the actual Oui Please box inside with a Thank You note on top of it and it's all protected with black bubble wrap.</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPleaseVol16Merci.jpg'></center>
<p>They also always include a Thank You note with each box, merci!</p>
<br>

<p>These boxes are my absolute favorite boxes from any subscription out there. It's gorgeous as a storage compartment, plus it's so BIG and sturdy, you can definitely use this for so many things. It also feels like a quality box made from high quality materials and you just know something luxurious is inside.</p>

<p>Now let's get back to unboxing!</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPleaseVol16OpenBox.jpg'></center>
<figcaption>First look at unboxing</figcaption>
<br>

<p>This month's ribbon is gold, fitting for a new year, and you also see the info magazine for Vol. 1.6.</p>

<figcaption>Second look at unboxing</figcaption>
<br>

<p>I wonder what's inside that white box, my guess is jewelry!</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPleaseVol16Info.jpg'></center>
<p>Oui Please always includes a catalog magazine listing all the items that were included for the current Volume box. I think it's great and so informational, plus they're made with such good quality, I collect all of them to browse around when I have French withdrawals.</p>
<br>

<p>Here's a look at some of the pages:</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Node By J.Fontes</b> Bague Sioul Gold Ring</DT>
<DD>Value $150</DD>
</DL>

<p>So this is what was inside that white box, a beautiful 14k gold plated ring! This ring was made entirely through 3D printing, which is new to me in the line of jewelry. It's definitely unique and personally I think the design is quite unisex so a guy could wear this too.<p>

<p>And here's a look at the ring on my finger:</p>
<center><img src='/images/OuiPleaseVol16NodeByJFontesBagueSioulRing3.jpg'></center>

<br>

<p>So yeah, unfortunately this ring is too big for my petite fingers. I even tried it on with my thumb as you can see. There's no sizing stated since the ring only came inside a red jewelry pouch with no brand packaging or info at all. But I did measure and the diameter is about 1.67cm which translates to size 7. Way too big for my size 4 fingers (yes, I'm that petite), so so sad. I really wanted to wear this! Oh well, I'll probably trade this with another subscriber or end up gifting it (sad face).</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Mirgiole</b> Sorbonne Earrings</DT>
<DD>Value $60</DD>
</DL>

<p>FYI, every subscriber received this pair of earrings.</p>

<p>These earrings are petite and gold, just how I like them. They have the "M" logo on each earring and can be worn with it shown or not shown. I absolutely love this!</p>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPleaseVol16HistoiresDeParfumsBlancViolette.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>Histoires Des Parfums</b> in Blanc Violette scent</DT>
<DD>Value $40</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've been enjoying the many different scents that Oui Please has been sending lately. I've definitely expanded my scent preferences and have found new fragrances that I never thought I'd like. This particular scent is too floral for me though. It's powdery, violet and floral overall. Sadly not for me so off it goes to be gifted.</p>

<DT><b>Tassia Cannelis</b> Oui Please Exclusive Bracelet</DT>
<DD>Value $50</DD>
</DL>

<p>I received a bracelet from this jeweler before and her designs are quite unique. This one in particular is a Oui Please exclusive design. With a delicate gold chain and a fresh water pearl chip as the charm, this is both simple yet feminine which is just my type of bracelet.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of the bracelet on me:</p>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPleaseVol16TassiaCannelisBracelet3.jpg'></center>

<p>I love how it looks on and I can totally wear this either by itself for a casual yet chic outfit, or layered for a more prominent look.</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPleaseVol16OolutionGlowUpMoisturizer.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>OOlution</b> Glow Up Moisturizer</DT>
<DD>Value $40</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This tube did not come sealed.</i></p>

<p>This moisturizer is made of 100% naturally derived ingredients, so it's free of parabens, phtalates and fragrance too. It's also anti-aging and detoxifying, and will help your skin achieve a healthy and glowing texture. I can't wait to try this!</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPleaseVol16HaremDesSensFabulousSilkMilk.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>Harem Des Sens</b> Fabulous Silk Milk</DT>
<DD>Value $30</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This lotion did not come sealed.</i></p>
<p>I can never have enough body lotions and I love the simple yet chic packaging of this one in particular. The scent is quite exotic and yet very feminine at the same time. I applied it to my hand and it went on really smooth, then it quickly dried and left my skin silky smooth. I kid you not. I only used it on one hand to compare and wow, there was quite a difference. They also suggest another use for this moisturizer which is to pour some of it into your bathwater for a Cleopatra-style beauty experience. That sounds like a plan and I can't wait to try that out!</p>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPleaseVol16LebonToothpaste.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>Lebon</b> Cinnamon-Mint Toothpaste</DT>
<DD>Value $17</DD>
</DL>

<p>A luxury toothpaste, well that has got to be a first for me. The tube looks gorgeous and I'm not sure I want to use this just yet, lol. Their products are paraben free and use 100% natural ingredients. This will be a major upgrade to my Tom's toothpaste!</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPleaseVol16LattelierLesLadures.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>L'Attelier</b> Ladure</DT>
<DD>Value $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>A mix of dark and milk chocolate disks with caramel and sea salt flower, need I say more. I love getting treats from this box because it's all so unique and exciting to try.</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPleaseVol16LattelierCaramelizedMacadamiaNuts.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>L'Attelier</b> Caramelized Macadamia Nuts</DT>
<DD>Value $15</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love me some Macadamia nuts, but caramelized, even better! This will go well with my afternoon cup of tea or a glass of wine!</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> <b>My Thoughts:</b> Oui Please gave me quite a number of jewelry in this box! I feel like I scored in getting a gorgeous ring, but since it doesn't fit me and it was the highest valued item in the box, I also feel somewhat disappointed. Everything else showed a great variation of products though and they all represented both quality and luxury. Ring aside, I did enjoy this box and still felt it had the value that I paid for if not more (I used a 20% coupon and purchased an annual subscription), so I'm totally happy with that. I always love receiving my Oui Please boxes and it's definitely one of my favorite boxes to subscribe to. I find so many amazing products through it that I wouldn't be exposed to otherwise since most of them are not available in the U.S. at all. That alone is worth it for me. But I do suggest using a coupon whenever subscribing to them so you won't feel disappointed when an item or two doesn't fit in size or preference. I'm hoping the next Oui Please box will ship on schedule since this one took quite a bit of delay and took quite a bit of patience from my end. But in the meantime, I guess it's back to Oui Please withdrawals again, lol ;)</p>

<p>If you haven't subscribed yet, you can <a href="http://ouipleasebox.com" target="_blank"><big>subscribe here</big></a> and use coupon code <b>OUIWHATSUP</b> to get 20% off any subscription. That brings the cost down to $120 for this box or $520 for a whole year! That's a très good deal!</p>
