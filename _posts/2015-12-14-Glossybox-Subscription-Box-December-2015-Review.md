<p>This month's box is a special design! It represents both December and the upcoming holidays well.</p>

<p>So far just by looking at them, I'm already loving these items more than last month's.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Color Club</b> Nail Polish in Feverish</DT>
<DD>Full Size .5 fl.oz., Value $8.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>I actually love getting nail polish in my subscription boxes. I can't even remember the last time I purchased one and my collection has grown considerably that I can probably open my own nail salon!</p>

<p>The color Feverish is a deep burgundy color that is both classy and sassy at the same time. I like the color and I also like the fact that these nail polishes are made in the USA!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Colorphlex</b> Leave-in Treatment & Detangler</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 2 oz., Value $11 (Full Size 4 fl.oz., $22)</DD>
</DL>

<p>"Color treated or not, this leave in treatment is the protection your hair needs to brace the changing seasons. Utilizing natural grape seed and fennel fruit extracts, styling your hair without any breakage will be a cinch."</p>

<p>I love geating leave-in treatments for my hair and can't wait to try this out.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Glossybox</b> Eyeshadow in Glossybox Mauve</DT>
<DD>Full Size .11 oz., Value $11</DD>
</DL>

<p>This eyeshadow pan is quite big and will surely last for quite awhile on me. The color is a dark purple mauve and I've found that a dark purple color actually can look great on my olive skintone.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the color:</p>

</a></center>

<br>

<p>I was so against wearing purple before, but now I find myself reaching for it when I want to add a slight pop of color to my eyes. It'll be great for a smokey eye look too.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>MTJ Cosmetics</b> High Definition Mascara</DT>
<DD>Full Size .32 fl.oz., Value $21</DD>

<p>"MTJ High Definition Mascara guarantees an extreme volume, intense colour and scenic eyelashes. Its texture is soft and creamy and application is extremely simple. The special curvy applicator in silicone allows eyelashes to be well separated and well lifted, without leaving clumps.".</p>

<figcaption>Closer look at the mascara brush</figcaption>

<br>

<p>I'm very picky with my mascaras and the type of brush it has for application, but this one sounds promising so I'll give it a try. Especially since it's Made in Italy and from their website, it seems like you can only purchase them in Italy, so that exclusive fact alone makes this worthy for me to try =)</p>

<img src="/images/GlossyboxDec2015OrogoldHandCream.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Orogold 24K Hand Cream" />
</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Orogold</b> 24K Hand Cream</DT>
<DD>Full Size 1 oz., Value $18</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love hand creams. I have them everywhere in my house (and in my bags) and this one feels extra luxurious, both because it's Orogold and also because it contains shea butter. Orogold is known to include gold into their ingredients for some of their products, but I don't think it's in this hand cream. It still moisturizes well and the scent is pleasant and not overwhelming. I may need to purchase more of this!</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This month included 4 full-sized items out of the 5 that they sent out, that's amazing! And the 1 non full-size item was half the size of a full-size, so that's still quite substantial. <a href="https://www.glossybox.com/referal?CI=MTMzODY3" target="_blank">Glossybox</a> has totally redeemed itself from <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Glossybox-Subscription-Box-November-2015-Review/" target="_blank">last month's box</a>. The items this time have a better variety and the brands featured are great as well, plus a special designed box too! I'll be using everything in this box, but my winning item has got to be the Orogold hand cream. So happy with this month's box, I'm now excited again to see what <a href="https://www.glossybox.com/referal?CI=MTMzODY3" target="_blank">Glossybox</a> has in plan for January! Can't wait!</p>
