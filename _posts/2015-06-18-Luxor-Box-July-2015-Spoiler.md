# First Spoiler for Luxor Box!

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJuly2015Spoiler.png"></center>

<p>I looked into <a href="http://robynrhodes.com" target="_blank">Robyn Rhodes website</a> and her jewelries are very boho chic. It's a great style to wear during spring or summer, and based on what I saw, I'm hoping its a bracelet or necklace and gold please since I'm not a silver person.</p>

<p>You can see her jewelries on celebrities, <a href="http://robynrhodes.com/celebrities.html/" target="_blank">click here to see pics of celebrities wearing them</a>, and there's quite a list.</p>

<p>Another thing I found interesting is that they offer a <a href="http://robynrhodes.com/mbox-1907.html" target="_blank">Mystery Box</a>. For $69 you get 3 mystery jewelry pieces, that's a pretty good deal considering one of her necklaces alone can cost more than that. And the good part is that you can choose gold or silver for your box.</p>

<p>I'm happy to see Luxor Box including a jewelry item again (I'm hoping its a trend here) since the last box had earrings that are my go-to for accessorizing now. You can read <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Luxor-Box-May-2015-Review/" target="_blank">my review of their previous (launch) box here</a>. The prices on the jewelries I've seen so far have also been quite a high value so that's a good sign. I'm not sure they'll release another spoiler, but if they do I will definitely post it!</p>

## What's Luxor Box?

The membership page will close once all the new available memberships are sold or at 11:59pm EST on June 24th (whichever comes first).</p>
