<br>

<p>Did I tell you how much I love opening my FabFitFun boxes, it brings out the giddy child in me!</p>

<p>I've seen some spoilers prior to receiving this box (one of them being the speakers), but even after that fact, it's a different feeling when you actually have it on hand. It's almost as if you never saw the spoiler (well somewhat), if you get what I mean.</p>

<p>These items are sooo perfect for summer and a day on the beach, in the park, or wherever your summer heart leads you. Love it!</p>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<DT><a href="http://tartecosmetics.com/tarte-item-lipsurgence-lip-gloss" target="_blank">Tarte LipSurgence Lip Gloss</a> in <i>True Love</i></DT>
<DD>Value $19</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm a Tarte fan, been for years and will be for years to come. They're a great cosmetic brand with healthy ingredients which is a must for me. I already own a lot of their lip products so I was happy to receive another one and in a color that I don't have too, thanks FabFitFun!</p>
<p>This lip gloss is in the color of "True Love" and it gives a pretty rich bright red color that's both semi-sheer and glossy. It does have a bit of a sting sensation upon application, but I love it since it let's me know that it's puckering my lips to a plumped up look, which is always welcomed.</p>

<DT>The Everyday Wireless Speaker by FabFitFun in <i>Pink</i></DT>
<DD>Value $29.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love listening to music wherever I go and whatever I do, it just keeps me sane and happy. I don't think people will appreciate me otherwise. Plus these speakers are in pink, totally me and totally in love with it. I tested it out right away and the sound quality is pretty good considering the price point. Of course I wasn't expecting Bose sound quality (and neither should you), but it does a pretty good job in terms of bluetooth music streaming.</p>
<p>Pairing was super easy and I also like the fact that you can charge through the included usb cable (no batteries needed here). The only thing I had a wee bit of issue with was that everytime you turn it on there would be an announcement from the device itself and it's actually pretty loud. It's a female voice that says "Bluetooth On!" You can change the volume setting for your music of course, just not the announcement which again is pretty loud. So that's my only gripe about it, nothing too big.</p>

<center><img src="/images/FabFitFunSummer2015Speakers2Copy.jpg"></center>
<p>I brought this to my recent Mexican trip and it was nice to have these speakers while I was laying on the beach versus using my iPhone. Saved the battery plus it didn't overheat the phone. Passed my test indeed!</p>

<DT><a href="http://wrenstudio.com/collections/accessories/products/rose-gold-luna-charm-necklace" target="_blank">WREN X FFF Rose Gold Luna Charm Necklace</a></DT>
<DD>Value $100</DD>
</DL>

<p>This was another item that they revealed earlier and I was most excited about. You would too if you knew you were getting a $100 necklace in a $40 box, yippee. Plus this 14 karat gold dipped necklace has a black sapphire on it as well, how cool is that.</p>
<p>I didn't pre-select my necklace since I wanted a surprise. FYI, if you're an annual subscriber you can select prior to shipment from the 3 available designs; heart, moon, or horseshoe. You can also select to have it in either gold or rose gold.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the necklace:</p>
<center><img src="/images/FabFitFunSummer2015Necklace2.jpg"></center>
<p>I don't own a lot of rose gold jewelry, mainly because it's not my favorite, but I actually love this necklace. I wore it throughout my vacation and I find myself grabbing for it more and more when I'm accessorizing a relaxed type of outfit. It's so dainty and cute, it goes perfect as the last finishing touch to your ensemble. And did I mention it's valued at $100? Score!</p>

<DT>Hello Konjac Cleansing Sponge</DT>
<DD>Value $12</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've been getting quite a lot of sponges in my subscription boxes lately. I'm not surprised since they are the "it" tool right now for skin cleansing. I like that it's a konjac sponge, I find the benefits matching my skin's needs so I'm happy to use this.</p>

<p>"Konjac root is an Asian-cultivated, root-based vegetable that the Japanese have traditionally used as a detoxifying dietary staple, and as a calming, exfoliating sponge for delicate skin. It is naturally alkaline and balances the acidity of the skin’s impurities and oils while being enriched with protein, carbohydrate, iron, phosphorus, copper, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin D, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and folic acid."</p>

<DT>FabFitFun x <a href="http://www.cosmobody.com" target="_blank">CosmoBody</a> Jump Rope</DT>
<DD>Value $14</DD>
</DL>

<p>So it's been quite a long time since I've actually used jump ropes, I think the last time was when I was in elementary, yikes! But I guess now is a good time as any to start using them again, especially since they're pink. I just can't say no to pink stuff, it's my kryptonite. I'm also super happy that these ropes match my speakers, so using them both together will make me look fashionably coordinated, yay!</p>

<DT><a href="http://gorgehair.com/products/i-ll-make-you-look-amazing-daily-spray" target="_blank">Gorge - I’ll make you look amazing daily spray</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size 4 oz, Value $24.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>OMG, this hair product is amazing! My hair is long, colored and pretty worked out. Leave-in hair conditioners are a must and since I rarely blow dry my hair, I need one that takes the frizz out without much effort from my end. This does it all and then some more! I use it after washing my hair and just let it air dry. Et voila, gorgeous hair! I also use it on dry hair for touch ups to make it shiny again a.k.a. revive it, and it works just as well without making my hair oily.</p>

<p>When you go to their website, the $24.95 price is actually a subscription price (they send you a bottle of this every month). If you want to just buy one bottle without the subscription, it actually costs $29.95. Just thought I'd mention that.</p>

<DD>Full Size 6.5 oz, Value $7.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>This is a sponsored item and at first I wasn't too excited about getting a Vaseline product in my box, mostly because it's a drugstore brand, but after I tried it on I can honestly say I'm impressed and will be buying more! The scent is heavenly and the spray is of good quality too. It sprays the product in a mist type of way, therefore distributing the lotion quite well wherever you direct it. Again, impressed with the quality. My only suggestion if they're taking any, is to make the bottle smaller. It's pretty tall and not travel friendly in my opinion. If they made this in a smaller size, I'd totally bring it with me everywhere. Just sayin.</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.inklingscents.com/#!shop/c199t" target="_blank">Inkling Scents Roll-On Oil Perfume in <i>Sultry</i></a></DT>
<DD>Full Size .3 oz, Value $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>Although I'm not a big fan of receiving perfumes in my subscription boxes, I actually loved this scent. It's floral, fresh and has just the right amount of sweetness. Very tropical and spring/summery in my opinion. Perfect for this box and thankfully perfect for me.</p>

<p>Also, if you go to their website you'll see they have unique bottles for their scents. One is a classic perfume type bottle with a feather quill to dip it in and put on your skin, how unique! I'm so getting one of those!</p>
<br>

<DL>
<DT><a href="https://www.goscratch.it" target="_blank">Scratch Nail Wraps</a></DT>
<DD>Value $8</DD>
</DL>

<p>Right now Scratch has special summer prices where all their nail wraps are priced at $8 versus $12, so I used the lesser amount for my value. These nail wraps are cool and they have so many other amazing designs on their website. I've used similar products in the past and they didn't work well on my petite fingers (it took a lot of work to get them to fit) so I'm not sure these are any different, but I'll give it a try.</p>

<p>They also have a monthly subscription called the "Monthly Mani Box" or MMB for short. It costs $30/monthly and you'll get 3 nail wraps, accents + extras, and a surprise gift in your box. If these nail wraps work for you, this subscription sounds mighty interesting.<p>

<DT><a href="https://www.headspace.com" target="_blank">Headspace 3-month Subscription</a></DT>
<DD>Value $38.85</DD>
</DL>

<p>Headspace is an online meditation program that will help you train your mind. They have many different programs to address various needs you may have so that you can focus more, worry less, sleep better, eat better... well you get the drift. Plus according to Neuroscientists, the practice of meditating your brain will physically change and reshape the brain in a positive way to help you gain your balance back. Sounds interesting and I'll definitely give this a try.</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I loved this box! I think it's a great combination of beauty, fitness, and lifestyle, plus it matched the summer theme really well. The only item I wasn't too impressed with were the nail wraps, but that's just me. Everything else I loved and will be using till they can't be used anymore. The total value came up to a whopping $279.78 and I'm super happy with that value. I think they've been stepping up their game lately with the items and I'm looking forward to their Fall box!</p>
