<DT>Collectors Addition Key Chain - Celebrating 100 years</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $12.50</DD>
<p>The keychain is stated as a collectors item since it’s made by hand to mark the 100th anniversary of the Rocky Mountains and is only made once. Because of that fact, I won’t argue on the stated retail value of this keychain, although it does seem inflated. It's not my favorite design, but I’ll happily accept another keychain to my collection.</p>

<DT>Moon Travel Book - Montana & Wyoming</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $15.72</DD>
<blockquote>Freelance writer and editor Carter G. Walker introduces you to the best of Montana and Wyoming, from the towering pines of Montana’s Glacier Country to the art scene and high style of Jackson Hole and Cody. A longtime resident of Montana, Walker has plenty of unique trip ideas to offer, including a Seven-Day Glacier Road Trip, Native American History & Culture, and Small Town Rodeos: The Biggest Parties in the West. Whether you’re looking to see bison and elk in Yellowstone National Park or attend the Fourth of July Rodeo in Livingston, Moon Montana & Wyoming gives you the tools you need to create a more personal and memorable experience.</blockquote>
<p>Escape Monthly always includes a Moon travel book in every box they send out. And since this month’s theme is The Rocky Mountains, the book is about Montana & Wyoming (including Yellowstone, Grand Teton & Glacier National Park).</p>

<DT>Sierra Nevada Soap Company - <a href="http://www.nevadasoap.com/index.php/our-store/product/14-rosemary-lavender">Rosemary Lavender Soap</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size $6.50</DD>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find a bath product in the box! This soap is very fragrant and since I love lavender, this was perfect for me. I also checked out their website and there’s quite an extensive variety of soaps that they offer. I’m interested in testing out their Hawaiian Sea Salt soap next!</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.shopsalus.com/Bath-Bombs-s/27.htm">Salus Bath Bomb</a> - Mountain Mint</DT>
<DD>Full Size 2 oz., $2.95</DD>
<p>This scent is so refreshing and I could actually smell it as soon as I opened the box. It's about the same size as a golf ball. It's not made with any coloring so it won't taint your tub, and it also includes great ingredients such as Organic Sunflower Oil, Cocoa Butter and Organic Shea Butter. I can’t wait to use it!</p>

<DT>NAAWK - <a href="http://www.naawk.com/sunscreen/adventure-eco-pack-spf-30.html">Adventure Ecopack SPF 30 Sunscreen Pouch</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size 2oz., $4.99</DD>
<p>The first thing I look in sunscreens is their ingredients and since this sunscreen does not have oxybenzone listed, I'm happy I'll be using this! At first I thought this was some sort of juice in one of those reusable drink pouches (I actually have a few that’s why I thought it was one of these). But the front label revealed it to be sunscreen -I was amazed. This is such a unique product and packaging, I’ll surely be using this in my next beach or hiking trip.</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.spiritgoat.com/proddetail.php?prod=aa-2cml">The Spirit Goat - Goat's Milk Lotion</a> in Bear Lake Raspberries</DT>
<DD>Deluxe travel size 4oz. (about half of full size), $4</DD>
<p>I’ve actually tried lotions made with goat’s milk in the past thanks to other subscription boxes, and I like it so I’m happy to have another one to try. The size is also pretty substantial compared to what I received in the past, but the scent is pretty sweet though, so be aware if you don't like sweet scents like me. I do like that the company donates a dollar for every full size bottle purchased on their website to the Cache County Children's Justice Center. </p>

<DT>Wild West Company - The Howdy Chocolate Bar (Dark Chocolate with Almonds)</DT>
<DD>2.25 oz. (64g), $3.50</DD>
<p>The packaging is cool and in line with the Rocky Mountains theme, plus I love trying out new chocolate brands and this one doesn’t disappoint.

<DT>Butchers Bunches - <a href="http://butchersbunches.com/shop/dirty-diana">Dirty Diana Preserve</a></DT>
<DD>2 oz., $1.80</DD>
<blockquote>Tart Montmorency Cherries from Brigham City (Woodyatt Farms) soaked in Passion Fruit Rum, and then pulsed into small pieces. While cooking citrus juice is added, a bit of sea salt and special spices just prior to setting to make a tart and tangy fruit spread. The lack of added sugar (or substitutes) emphasizes the wonderful flavor of these cherries that are normally uses for pies.</blockquote>
<p>The jar is small but I'm still happy to receive such an item in my box. Reading the ingredients makes me want to try it asap, especially the part where it says "soaked in Passion Fruit Rum"!</p>

<DT>Kate's Real Food - <a href="http://store.katesrealfood.com/kates-stash-bar/">Stash Bar</a> (Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate)</DT>
<DD>2.2 oz. (62g), $2.79</DD>
<blockquote>The natural sugars and protein provide sustained energy, while the amino acids from the hemp seeds help your body utilize it. The flax seeds give you an added boost of omega 3 and antioxidants.</blockquote>
<p>The bar is made with non GMO and organic ingredients. I depend on natural energy bars such as this when I'm off on my outdoor adventures, and I can't wait to try this out on my next trip.</p>

<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.rockymountainsoda.com/flavors/">Rocky Mountain Soda Co. - Root Beer</a></DT>
<DD>12 fl. oz., $3</DD>
<p>This is an all natural soda company using Gluten Free, non GMO, Vegan, and Kosher ingredients. Since I do like Root Beer, I was excited to try this. The packaging looks cool and vintage, and the taste was great as well. Not too sweet like the brand name one. I wonder if any of my local stores carry this brand, I will definitely be on the lookout next time I go for a grocery run.</p> 

<p><b>VERDICT:</b> I was actually expecting less from this box being that the theme was The Rocky Mountains. I never expected such a great variety of food, bath products and souvenir. I would say that this is my favorite Escape Monthly box I’ve received so far! I found that some of the prices were inflated though when calculating the actual item versus full size as well as comparing them on Amazon, so I did my own values on some of them. The total value added up to $57.75 and I think that’s pretty good for a travel subscription box, especially since it's over the $40 price of the subscription. This box has inspired me to visit Montana and go hiking soon!</p>
