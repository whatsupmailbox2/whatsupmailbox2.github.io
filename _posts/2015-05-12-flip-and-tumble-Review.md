<p><b>The Product:</b> <a href="http://www.flipandtumble.com/shop/247bag/shop247.php">flip & tumble - 24/7 Reusable Bag</a></p>
<p><b>The Price:</b> $12 (buy 1-2), $10 (buy 3-6), $9 (buy 7+)</p>

<p>I was first introduced to this amazing reusable bag when I got my Popsugar April box. 
I loved it so much that I just had to add more to my collection, especially since they had other popping colors available. 
Plus they included a 20% coupon in the Popsugar box so that was a #NoBrainer.</p>

<p>Shipping was also super fast! They ship the next business day and since they're in California, I got mine pretty much the next day.</p>

<p>The bag is so small and light, I can carry this even in my smallest bag.
And when I'm done using it, I just gather it all back into a ball and flip a small flap to keep it closed, so easy! 
It really is.</p>

<p>Here's some details on sizing and capacity from their website:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>bag size = 12" x 14" x 5" = large enough for 3 half gallons of milk and then some</li>
<li>ball size = 3" in diameter = the size of a peach</li>
<li>weight capacity = 35 lbs. = strong enough for a bowling ball or two</li>
<li>compacting system = premium stretch = like a sockball</li>
<li>material = ripstop nylon</li>
<li>felt patch = keeps the bag on your shoulder</li>
<li>washing instructions = machine wash cold, hang to dry</li>
<li>plastic bags spared = 1,000+</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I've tested this during my grocery shopping trips and amazingly enough it does withhold a sizeable weight and yet still comfortable on your shoulders. The best part is when I unfold it from a ball into a bag right in front of the cashier, it never ceases to amazes them =)</p>
