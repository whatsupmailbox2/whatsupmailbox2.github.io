<DT>Strawberry Greek Yogurt Pretzels</DT>
<DD>Net Wt. 4 oz</DD>
</DL>
<p>OMG, these pretzels taste amazing! It's crunchy, sweet, fruity, and salty all in one! The strawberry flavor bursts with abundance as soon as it enters in your mouth, then once you crunch on it, you immediately taste the salty goodness of the pretzel. I literally had to stop myself from finishing this bag in one sitting!</p>
<p>They also offer this in Blueberry flavor which is what I'll be ordering next =P</p>

<DT>Salt & Pepper Lentil Loops</DT>
<DD>Net Wt. 3 oz</DD>
</DL>
<p>This is one of my favorite snacks from them and a permanent recurring item in my snack pantry. Trader Joe's has a version of these lentil loops, but <a href="http://fbuy.me/dksQC" target="_blank">Nature Box</a> steps it up a notch by adding pepper in the flavor which may not seem like a big deal, but wow, it really makes a difference in flavor. I only wish they made this in a bigger bag because I always end up finishing it in 2 sittings, ooops.</p>

<DT>Lemon Tea Biscuits</DT>
<DD>4 Single Serves, Net Wt. 1 oz each</DD>
</DL>
<p>I decided to try this tea biscuit out since they had it in single-serve portions which will be great as my to-go snacks. It's not overly sweet, has a buttery cookie taste to it, and a slight lemon flavor to finish it off. Although it's not a bad cookie to have, it also didn't wow me in any way so I'm glad I got to try it out, but I don't think I'll be ordering these again.</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> As always, <a href="http://fbuy.me/dksQC" target="_blank">Nature Box</a> fulfills my snack needs and this month came with a new favorite discovery, the Strawberry Greek Yogurt Pretzels! It's such a treat to have awesome snacks delivered to your door every month, and when it does arrive, it becomes official snack tasting day lol. I've already selected what I want to order for next month, so check back to see that review.</p>
