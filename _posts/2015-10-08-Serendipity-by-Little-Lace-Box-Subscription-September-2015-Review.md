<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b">Serendipity by Little Lace Box</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $9.99 bi-monthly (on the off months of the Little Lace Box) with Free Shipping</p>
<p><b>Products:</b> You'll receive 5-7 sample size (sometimes full-size) items that Little Lace Box deemed great finds and wanted to share. Since it's still new, I can't really say what you probably would expect from this subscription, so I'll leave it at that for now.</p>
<br>

<p>This is their first package coming out of their test phase. They initially offered this free for all current Little Lace Box subscribers, and after 2 shipments, they're up and running.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see a white padded envelope from Little Lace Box. They typically send their items in red padded envelopes.</p>

<p>Now there's the red envelope that I've come to know too well =)</p>

<DT>OFRA Cosmetics - Eyeliner in Brown</DT>
<DD>Full Size .04 oz., Value $12.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>This is a water resistant eyeliner. I'm not too fond of eyeliners that have to be sharpened and I end up trying it once then never using it again, so I'll have to pass this along.</p>

<DT>Beekman 1802 - Honeyed Grapefruit Facial Cleansing Wipes</DT>
<DD>Full Size 30 wipes, Value $7</DD>
</DL>
<p>Gently scented with notes of red grapefruit, guava and lemon blossom they smell pretty good. It's also infused with real goat milk, aloe, calendula, chamomile & vitamins to keep them from drying out your skin.</p>

<p>I was actually quite surprised that these only cost $7. I think 30 wipes for $7 sounds like such a deal! They're actually pretty decent in size too, unlike other facial wipes that are pretty small, these are quite large. I love that, it will surely cover a lot of area for cleansing. I also love that it's paraben and sulfate free. </p>

<DT>Beekman 1802 - Wondermint Lip Balm Stick</DT>
<DD>Full Size, Value $8</DD>
</DL>
<p>I was wondering what was in this tube, and I'm happy to report that it's a lip balm! I can never have enough lip balms, I have them eh-ve-ry-where!</p>

<p>This has a minty feel when applying it on, but not strong at all, just very light. It applied very smoothly and most importantly, it moisturized my lips really well. I'm loving this lip balm, straight to my bag it goes!</p>

<p>Formulated with Dead Sea Minerals, Aloe Vera and essential oils to balance the scalp PH and add moisture and minerals to your hair. It's free of harmful chemicals, sulfates, parabens, phthalate and artificial fragrance. That's music to my ears, can't wait to try this out!</p>

<br>

<p><b>My Thoughts:</b> This month's items were pretty good, especially for $9.99! I love and will use everything except the Ofra eyeliner, so I'm happy with that. This is their first package out of their test phase where they offered it for free to current LLB subscribers, so I did pay $9.99 for this and I'm absolutely content with the items I received with what I paid. The products inside came from brands that I don't currently use but have been wanting to try out, so that in itself was valuable to me. This subscription is quite unpredictable (last month we got a tea steeper) so it's always exciting to see what I get everytime. Can't wait to see what they come up with in the next package!</p>
