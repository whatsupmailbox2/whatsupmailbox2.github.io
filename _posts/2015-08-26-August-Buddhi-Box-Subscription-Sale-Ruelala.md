</a></center>

<p>Here are the prices on <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Rue La La</a>:
<ul>
<li>1 month $24.99 (reg. $30.95)</li>
<li>3 months $69.99 (reg. $86.95)</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Validity: August 27 through November 27, 2015, unless prohibited by law. Taxes are not included. A $5 flat-rate shipping charge will apply upon redemption; a $10.99 shipping charge will apply upon redemption in Canada. Limited to two offers per person, one offer per transaction. Up to one additional offer may be purchased as a gift.</i></p>

<p>As you can see from the prices above, the 6-months deal is where you save the most, but if you're not ready to commit that long, the 1-month deal is pretty good too if you just want to try them out.</p>

<p>I always <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">purchase through Rue La La</a> for subscriptions that I'm not currently subscribed to and would like to try out. You always save money through these deals, that's why I recommend them to everyone!</p>

<p>*Note: By purchasing on <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Rue La La</a>, you will be enrolled in their monthly subscription plan after your period ends, so make sure to cancel prior if you don't plan on keeping the subscription. You can cancel through your online account so no need for awkward phone calls here.</p>
