<p><b>The Box:</b> <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">Popsugar Special Edition Fall 2015</a></p>
<p><b>The Cost:</b> I'm guessing it will be the same price as their Summer Special Edition box which is $100 (one time purchase)</p>
<p><b>WHATâ€™S IN THE BOX:</b> Special Edition boxes are indulgent onetime purchases that feature exclusive items and unique collaborations.</p>
<br>

<p>The <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">Popsugar Special Edition Fall 2015 Box</a> will be on sale on August 20th!</p>

<p>There's only limited quantities of these boxes so if you plan on purchasing one, be ready that day to purchase as soon as it's available (it gets sold out quickly from past experience).</p>

<p>No spoilers have been released for this box yet which is typical of their special edition boxes, but I'm sure it will still get sold out fast even still. 
I purchased the Summer 2015 box and it was so amazing (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/products/reviews/Popsugar-Must-Have-Special-Edition-Summer-2015-Box-Review/" target="_blank">you can read the review here</a>) it was totally worth the $100 and more, so I'm totally getting the Fall 2015 box!</p>

<p>Are you planning on getting one too? Let me know!</p>
