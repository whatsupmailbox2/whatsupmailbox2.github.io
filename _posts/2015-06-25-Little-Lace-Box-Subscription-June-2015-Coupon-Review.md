<p>This is one of my favorite subscription boxes that I subscribe to, so I always get excited when it arrives! And this month I'm extra excited since the theme is a quote by Coco Chanel (a quote that I live by) "A girl should be two things, classy & fabulous". Anything that has to do with the great madame Coco Chanel is a win already in my book!</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.sandiegohat.com/store/women-s-ultrabraid-large-brim-visor.html" target="_blank">San Diego Hat Co. - The Packable Summer Hat in Black & White Stripes</a></DT>
<DD>Value $28</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>FYI, as far as I know for now, subscribers either got the hat in Brown or Black & White stripes.</i></p>

<p>I had to grab this item first as I was unboxing, it just looked gorgeous and classy, so Coco Chanel... she would definitely wear this.</p> 

<p>And the best part, it's packable -how awesome is that! See picture below how it looks when its rolled up.</p>

<DT>Little Lace Box - Pour Some Sugar Scrub On Me in Lollabambooza</DT>
<DD>Full Size 8 oz., Value $19.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm loving all the sugar scrubs I've been receiving in subscription boxes lately and this one smells amaze-balls! I want this same scent in a lotion please!</p>
<br>

<DT>Watercolor Print Silk Scarf exclusively made for LLB</DT>
<DD>Value $45.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>Wow, the colors on this scarf are so vibrant and poppin, I feel a bit intimidated by it lol. I'm not really a scarf person, but I can totally see this wrapped on my bag or on my hat like they suggested. I have so many black bags and hats that this scarf will surely add some life to it. Plus its made with 100% silk which makes it a luxury item you can add on anything for that extra touch of class.</p>

<DT>Kitsch - Ring with Amethyst stone</a></DT>
<DD>Value $24.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>Oh how I wish I had normal sized fingers. I have petite, and I mean super petite (think size 3.5) fingers so sadly I won't be able to wear this -but I really want to! The ring was made exclusively for LLB and it's also made from 14K gold with high quality stones. Subscribers either got the Amethyst stone or the Turquoise stone, and they both look lovely.</p>

<DT><a href='http://www.lucybcosmetics.com/nails2.php#' target="_blank">Lucy B. Cosmetics - Nail Lacquer in Starlet</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size 12ml, Value $13</DD>
</DL>

<p>Lucy B. Cosmetics was founded by Lucy Baldock-Sacchi who was a make-up artist to celebrities for over fifteen years before she founded the company with her top advertising Photographer husband, Marco Sacchi. Their products are natural and organic, and they are the only fragrance and colour range in the world to have infused the natural Australian Flower Essences within their products.</p>
<p>The color Starlet looks very natural on nails, I would say it's a light nude peach, definitely an everyday type of color. It also dries pretty quick to my surprise! This nail lacquer is 4-free of Formaldehyde, Toluene, Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP), and Camphor. Plus LLB paired the colors of the nail polishes with the type of ring they included. So if you received the Amethyst ring, you'll receive this Starlet color. If you got the Turquoise ring, you'll get the Premier color which is a more taupe color. LLB always thinks of everything!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I am wowed again by <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b" target="_blank">Little Lace Box</a> and I can tell that they put a lot of thought into curating this box with the theme. I could actually wear every single item in this box together! If that isn't a perfectly themed box, I don't know what is. My favorite item of the box has got to be the hat and I'm already trying to secure another color asap. The total value came up to $131.97 which is an amazing value for a $59.99 subscription -that's more than double the cost! Plus every item inside is quality and totally on par for a lifestyle subscription. If you haven't subscribed and you're looking for a great lifestyle subscription, I totally recommend this box -it's hands down one of my favorite subscriptions!</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b" target="_blank"><big>subscribe here</big></a> to start receiving their next box which will be in August, and the theme for that box is "Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy". And don't forget to use coupon code <b>REDLACE</b> to get $10 off your subscription!</p>
