<p>Ipsy always ships their bags in bright neon pink padded envelopes, it's hard to miss it in your mailbox!</p>

<p>Ipsy is very similar to Birchbox where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependent on the answers you give in the Ipsy beauty quiz. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items. And you can retake the beauty quiz at anytime if you feel that the products didn't really match you.</p>

<p>This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.</p>

<p>Every month Ipsy sends their items in makeup bags that they produce exclusively. This month's design is quite galactic, I'm still deciding if I like it or not.</p>

<p>They also include a card noting the theme for the month and in the back is a short note from them and as always, a chance to win one-year of Glam Bag subscription.</p>

<H4>And here are my items:</H4>

<p>Call me crazy, but I love getting nail polishes in my subs. It's fun to try new brands and colors, and this one seems like an all-season natural color so I'm quite happy.</p>

<p>Dermelect's 'ME' peptide infused nail polish is quite unique in that it's "infused with a pure protein peptide extracted from New Zealand sheepâ€™s wool, the lacquers deliver a fast drying, high gloss shine while providing an unequaled level of strength for stubborn nails to grow longer and more resistant to chipping, peeling and splitting." 

<p>Here's a picture from their site with the color on:</p>

<p>I applied only 1 coat to my nails and it's not as dark as the picture above. Application was easy and smooth, and it dried up really fast too.  I'm totally lovin this nail polish!</p>

<DD>Full Size 0.3 oz., Value $10?</DD>
</DL>

<p>I couldn't find both the eyeliner and the brush on the brand's website, so I'm guessing the value based on the prices of their other brushes and products. Based on what I see listed on their website, this seems like a drugstore (or somewhat cheap) brand. I'll still try it though and I definitely appreciate the brush included as well, so this was still a win.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the color of the eyeliner:</p>

</a></center>

<p>The color is stated as Navy but it looks a bit brighter than Navy to me. Either way, you can always build the color to make it darker if needed.</p>

<p>I got one of their eye shadow crayons in my past Ipsy bag and loved it, so I was super stoked to get their lip crayon. I tried it on right away and thankfully the color suits me well, it's a darker nude color which is perfect for my olive skin tone. It's also matte and it lasts long too. Even when it wears off, it leaves a tint which is great for me. So happy I got this!</p>

<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 0.14 fl.oz./3 ml., Value $7.37</DD>

<p>I'm quite picky with my mascaras, only because I have hard to curl eyelashes. I've sampled this mascara before and I remember that it didn't really do it for me, so I'll either be passing this along to someone or stashing it in my emergency makeup bag.</p>

<p>An oil-free moisturizer that features Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramides and all-natural water binding mechanisms for skin. I love that it's oil-free, a must in my moisturizers, so I'll be using this for sure!</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Ipsy is always fun to receive since I get to discover and try new products at only $10/month which is so reasonable. Thankfully this month's items were much better than last month's and although I'll be using 4 out of the 5 items, the value is totally there for me, as always. My favorite has got to be the nail polish and lip crayon. Both great discoveries and products which will be a staple in my makeup stash.</p>
