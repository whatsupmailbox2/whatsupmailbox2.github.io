<DL>
<DT>Hudson + Bleecker - Labyrinth Onyx Travel Trio</DT>
<DD>Value $42</DD>
</DL>

<p>These wine bags are cute in design and I also love the brown paper bag material as well. I think I'll tie it with some burlap ribbon to give it that extra retro pop look. Can't wait to use this soon!</p>

<DT>Too Faced - Brow Envy Brow Shaping & Defining Kit</DT>
<DD>Value $39</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've had this body scrub before since I'm subscribed to Honest Co's subscription bundle, and although it's not my favorite, it's not bad as well. It's very moisturizing so it leaves a layer of moisturizer when you use this scrub which in turn makes it a bit slippery on your skin, so just be careful about that. The scent is a bit too sweet for me though but that's my personal preference, I like more of a fresh or floral scent for my scrubs.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Richer Poorer Socks</DT>
<DD>Value $35</DD>
</DL>

<p>These socks are in one of my favorite colors, pink, plus it has grippers on the bottom too so you can walk around with these and feel fully secure that you won't slip and fall, love them!</p>

<DT>Why Not Me? by Mindy Kaling</DT>
<DD>Hardcover, Value $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>I loved her first book, "Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?", so I knew I just had to have her second book when I found about it but just didn't find the time to purchase it in my Kindle. Now I'm glad I procrastinated and can't believe Popsugar read my needs. I've already started reading this book as soon as I got my hands on it and it's been hilarious so far!</p>

<DT>Savvy Sleepers Luxury Satin Pillowcase</DT>
<DD>1 Pillowcase, Value $36</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm a sucker for luxury linen so needless to say, I was super happy to receive this. I may need to get my hands on another case though as a pair seems fair for my husband to enjoy this as well =)</p>

<p>The pillowcase has a compartment on the inside of the opening for you to store some small personal items or pretty much anything you need at night at a moments notice. How thoughtful and conveninent!</p>

<DL>
<DT>Nourish Snacks - Almond to Cherries</DT>
<DD>Value $2</DD>
</DL>

<p>These snacks look healthy and delish. The almonds are salty and the cherries are both sweet and sour. It's a good mix of flavor and of course a healthy snack to have when you're having the munchies or need a burst of energy.</p>

Each code behind these cards are unique. </p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I really liked the items this month, it was a good mix of products and I especially loved the earrings in those cute message bottles! Plus I got introduced to some awesome new brands which is the main reason why I subscribe to boxes in the first place. The total value came up to $156 (I didn't include the <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">Popsugar</a> promo cards) and that's a pretty high value. Next month's theme is "Breast Cancer Awareness, Cozy, Autumn, Restful Nights" and I can't wait to see what that brings! Checkout my review next month lovelies!</p>
