<p>Love the colors and prints on the box! And more importantly, the wines were packed neatly and safely inside.</p>

<p>This month we chose the <big><b>Eastern Bloc Party</b></big> box and its filled with 3 wines from Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>They always include a small magazine that details the theme, the wines, recipes that pair well with each wine and some small fun facts that relates to the theme.</p>

<DT>And here are the wines:</DT>

<p>This was the least favorite out of all three for me. It was too dry, tart and did not go down smooth at all for me. If you like Spanish wines that are dry and tart, this might be for you. I tried drinking it both room temperature and cold, and neither really did it for me, so sadly this was a miss.</p>

<DD><i>Muscat</i></DD>
<DD>Etyek-Buda, Hungary</DD>

<p>Now this wine I loved! It was bubbly, not overly sweet and fruity. Not just any fruit too, it tasted very tropical and fresh. This without a doubt was my favorite wine from the box! I want more!</p>

<DL>
<DT>2013 Bernreiter Grüner Veltliner</DT>
<DD><i>Grüner Veltliner</i></DD>
<DD>Vienna, Austria</DD>
</DL>

<p>I actually didn't know this till I read it from the Wine Awesomeness magazine, but Vienna literally means "wine"! How did I not know that!</p>

<p>This wine is very fresh and fruity with just a tiny bit of sweetness. With aromas of peach and citrus, it was smooth and well balanced on the palate. Definitely would go well with just about anything.</p>

<H4><i class="icon-gift"></i> Bonus item:</H4>
<center><img src='/images/WineAwesomenessJune2015Bonus.jpg'></center>

<p>They included a pack of Starbucks Guatemala Laguna de Ayarza ground coffee, which was a nice surprise. Plus there's a $2 coupon inside that's good for 1 bag of Starbucks coffee, not bad.</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Living in California, we're spoiled with the bountiful selection of local wines that are top notch. But because there's so many of them, its hard to explore and find hidden treasures amongst all of them, let alone find great wines that are produced elsewhere. I find that this subscription allows me to do that and I love how they curate it around a theme and include a very informative and fun magazine as well. I've had other wine subscsriptions, but I think this one is pretty unique in what it delivers. And although I didn't really like one of the wines in my box, the other two were really great that it made up for it. I wonder what theme they'll come up with next month!</p>
