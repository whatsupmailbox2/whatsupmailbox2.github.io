<p>Ipsy always ships their bags in bright neon pink padded envelopes, it's hard to miss and I always get happy when I see it in my mailbox!</p>

<p>Ipsy is very similar to <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependent on the answers you give in the Ipsy beauty quiz. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items. And you can retake the beauty quiz at anytime if you feel that the products didn't really match you.</p>

<p>This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.</p>

<p>Every month <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy</a> sends their items in makeup bags with an exclusive design. This month's design celebrates Valentine's Day with a heart symbol and is really cute, I like it! The texture also has little raised bumps giving it a textured look.</p>

<p>Here's a look at the back of the bag:</p>

</a></center>

<br>

<p>Every bag also includes a note from them depicting the theme of this month's glam bag.<p>

<p>This month's theme is "Pretty in Ipsy Pink", and since it's their signature color, their celebrating it by including this shade in every glam bag.</p>

<br>

<H4> And here are my Ipsy February 2016 items:</H4>

<DL>
<DT><b>BelláPierre Cosmetics</b> Mineral Blush in Desert Rose</DT>
<DD>Sifter Jar 6g (Full Size is 9g), Value $30</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This blush has an inside sticker seal and every subscriber receiving this will get the shade Desert Rose.</i></p>

<p>It's been awhile since I've used a loose powdered blush, I'm just too lazy to swirl, tap and buff. But I'm open to trying it out again. Plus this came in quite a large sized jar (hurray) so this will surely last me for quite some time.</p>

<p>This blush looks great and goes on quite naturally on my olive skin tone. It's also talc-free, paraben-free, and suitable for all skin types and conditions which is music to my ears. So glad I got this!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>IT Cosmetics</b> Bye Bye Under Eye® Anti-Aging Concealer in Tan</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 0.11 fl.oz. (Full Size .28 fl.oz.), Value $9.50</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: ipsters who receive this product will receive the shade Light, Medium, or Tan.</i></p>

<p>I appreciate the fact that they actually matched the shade of this concealer to my actual skin color. I looked into my beauty profile and I did indicate Tan as my skin tone, so if you got this too, it should be matched to the skin tone you stated in your beauty profile.</p>

<p>This concealer went on smoothly and did not settle on my lines or looked patchy. This will be life saving on those days where I wake up with those dreaded dark circles.</p>

<DT>Olivia Palermo x Ciaté London Paint Pot in "Sundays - My Off Duty Nude"</DT>
<DD>Mini Paint Pot .17 oz, Value $9</DD>
</DL>

<p>When I saw the reveal of my glam bag earlier this month, I knew I was getting this nail polish and wasn't too excited but now that I have it on hand, I actually love it especially since it's an Oliva Palermo x Ciaté London color.</p>

<br>

<img src="/images/IpsyFeb2016CiateLondonOliviaPalermoPaintPotSundaysMyOffDutyNude2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

<p>The name of the color is very fitting especially for today, a Sunday! It's also a nice pretty pastel pink that I can really wear everyday. See picture below.</p>

<p>I applied two coats (one coat was too sheer for me) and it has this plumping feature as well so it evens out the surface of your nails. It's also "formulated with an exclusive and advanced Dual Polymer Mesh Lock Technology that was specially developed to create a long lasting, durable, high-shine lacquer". It looks great on my olive tanned skin, but I think it'll look great on any skin tone as well. It just looks feminine and an all around great everyday color.</p>

<DT><b>VINTAGE by Jessica Liebeskind</b> Sparkling Lipgloss in Pink Sequin</DT>
<DD>Full Size 0.14 OZ. / 4.0 g, Value $21</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This lipgloss came sealed.</i></p>

<p>Although the packaging is different, it looks shorter and almost half sized of the regular full size tube you would get directly from the brand, the actual amount is the same which is 0.14 oz. making this in fact Full Sized, so I was super happy with that!</p>

<p>The color Pink Sequin is a light and sparkly icy-pink lilac. Although I'm not big on shimmer for my lips (I'm more of a matte girl), I will still be trying this and hopefully it wouldn't be too shimmery for my taste.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Skinfix</b> Ultra Rich Body Butter</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 1 oz., Value $2</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This jar did not come sealed.</i></p>

<p>I've never heard of this brand before. It's a Canadian company (all their products are made in Canada) and is sold in Target. The texture is thick and creamy, which is what I would expect any ultra moisturizing lotion should be. My elbows have been quite dry lately so I tested this on there right away and it really did moisturize the area well. Made with natural ingredients of shea butter, coconut oil and sunflower oil. It's also fragrance free, the only scent I noted was the shea butter but it wasn't too strong. This was a great lotion to try!</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I wasn't too excited initially when I saw the reveal of my items earlier this month, but now that I have everything in my hands and have used some of them, I'm actually quite happy with it. Especially since the total value came up to $71.50 which is really good for the $10 cost. This month's item had a great variation in products and I really did like the nail polish plus will be using everything else so that's a win for me!</p>
