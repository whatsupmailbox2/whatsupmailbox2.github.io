<p>I was envying my husband's new watch he got from <a href="http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8" target="_blank">Sprezza Box</a> so this definitely made my day.</p>

<p>This La Boh√®me rose gold watch is from one of Rachel Zoe's favorite Dutch brands, CLUSE. It includes interchangeable black and grey straps, and is valued at $132! How awesome is that! #soexcited</p>

<p>If you haven't subscribed yet, the Fall Box is still available and you can <a href="http://thezoereport.com/shop/" target="_blank">subscribe here</a> to get a hold of one. Just don't wait too long as it tends to get sold out quickly as soon as a reveal gets released, and this watch will definitely attract subscribers!</p>
