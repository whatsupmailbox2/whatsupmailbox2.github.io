<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="http://www.allure.com/beauty-products/beauty-box" target="_blank">Allure Beauty Box</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $15/monthly (taxes apply to CA)</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> At least five products that are a mix of full-sized and deluxe-sized items from major brands and innovative newcomers that Allure editors deem the best of the best. Plus, you'll also get a special-edition "mini magazine" chock full of the most trusted product reviews you've come to expect from Allure.</p>

<br>

<p>This box is the new version of Allure Sample Society. The changes are perhaps seen more in the curated items, better selections and quality, but the price remains the same.</p>

<p>I actually received this box last week but life has been hectic and I finally had the time to do the review today.</p>

<p>Every box comes with a "mini magazine" that details all the items in the box, their benefits and ingredients, prices and where to buy.</p>

<p>Here's the pages from the mini magazine:</p>

<H4>And here are my items:</H4>

<p>I'm super ecstatic on getting a Tangle Teezer in this box, I love them and it's also in my favorite color too, Pink. #score.</p>

<br>

<DT><a href="https://www.tangleteezer.com/proddetail.php?prod=NO-HH-011012" target="_blank">The Original Tangle Teezer in Pink Fizz</a></DT>
<DD>Value $15</DD>
</DL>

<p>Again, I was pleasantly surprised to see this item in the box, especially since I'm already a fan.</p>

<p>This is the "Original Detangling Hairbrush" that features a patented teeth formation that bends and flexes throughout the hair without locking into tangles. It minimizes hair breakage and cuticle damage while adding shine. It is ergonomically designed to fit snugly in your palm for creative styling and easy handling.</p>

<br>

<p>I have this comb in the compact version which includes a click-on, click-off cover that protects the tool’s teeth from dirt and damage. This one doesn't have that, but it is bigger and feels more comfortable on my hands when I'm brushing my hair versus the compact one.</p>

<p>You might not think it, but those teeth formation really does glide through tangles, magically. I love this brush!</p>

<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 4ml, Value $6 (Full Size 10ml $14)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love lip products with plumping effects so I was happy to see this in my box. I also love Soap & Glory and have some of their bath and skincare products. They're a UK brand that's known for their amazing lotions, retro packaging and funny product names.</p>

<p>As with all lip plumping products, you'll feel a tingle when applying this on. It wasn't instant, but you feel it gradually as it stays longer on your lips. The scent is sweet and chocolatey, the look is slightly glossy, and the color is a natural sheer light pink. Great item for me.</p>

<DD>Travel Size 25ml, Value $5 (Full Size 150ml $30)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love Alterna, I have and use a lot of their products and have never been disappointed. This leave-conditioner in particular works wonders on my long dry straight hair. Although it says its a spray, it actually comes out like a cream dispenser so it doesn't shoot out like a spray. Definitely dispense on your palm. I used about a quarter size and applied it on damp towel-dried hair, then I blow dried with a diffuser. The end result was soft and smooth hair that felt good and strong. This will be a staple in my haircare.</p>

<DD>Sample Size 15ml/0.5fl.oz, Value $2 (Full Size 250ml $29</DD>
</DL>

<p>I actually like Pixi by Petra, but mostly use their makeup and not skincare so I'm excited to try this. Plus it's a toner which is a must have in my skincare regimen, so that was perfect. This toner gently exfoliates to even out skintone for a brighter, smoother and more glowing complexion. Hence the name Glow Tonic. I like it and this size will be perfect for when I travel.</p>

<DD>Sample Size 0.6oz./17g., Value $5 (Full Size 5.3oz. $45</DD>
</DL>

<p>

<p>This face soap smells amazing! It's fresh, beachy and so uplifting. At first I thought it was a body bar (a very tiny one). But then I read the description on the info booklet plus their website and realized it's a face bar. Now that makes sense.</p>

<p>This is a moisturizing soap that gets rid of dirt, clears away oil and impurities that block needed nutrients, plus it balances and binds moisture to skin. Although I'm not big on washing my face with a soap bar, I will surely try this because the scent is just so amazing.</p>

<DD>Sample Size 7ml/0.24fl.oz., Value $7 (Full Size 50ml $48)</DD>
</DL>

<p>This product won the Allure Best of Beauty in 2014, so that says a lot. It has anti-aging properties that evens skin tone, minimizes the appearance of pores and increase radiance. I do wear primers plus I've known Jane Iredale products to be healthy and quality so I'm happy to try this out.</p>

<DD>Sample Size 3ml/0.10oz., Value $17 (Full Size 1oz. $170)</DD>
</DL>

<p>This skin transforming serum combines 50% Hyaluronic Acid with Plant Stem Cells and Nobel Prize-winning DNA technology to redefine facial contours by firming and resurfacing the skin. Hyaluronic Acid is the ingredient that Juvederm, Restylane and other plumping injectables have. This serum has 50% which will surely work wonders in plumping and smoothing out wrinkles without the pain. That and the added moisturizing ingredients makes this quite a mighty serum. It better be since 1 ounce of it costs $170! My wallet is hoping I don't fall in love with this, but I think I just might, sigh.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This box was awesome, especially for $15! The Tangle Teezer alone costs that much, plus that serum is worth $17! And not just that, I will surely use every item (if I haven't already done so) so that makes this even more worth it. The total value of this box came up to $57 which again is pretty amazing for the cost of this box. Definitely a great subscription to have if you're into beauty and skincare, but also want some full-sized items in your box.</p>
