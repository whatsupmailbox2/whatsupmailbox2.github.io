<DT>Benefit Cosmetics - They're Real! Mascara</a></DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 0.1oz, Value $8 (Full Size 0.3oz., $24)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've used this mascara before and had great results so I'm happy to have another one. They're good for a more natural lengthening look that I typically go for everyday. I'd still use an eyelash curler if you have straight lashes like I do.</p>

<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 10ml, Value $10.70 (Full Size 14ml, $15)</DD>
</DL>

<p>The color Uptown is a dusky pink color that looks great for an everyday natural look. It does go on very creamy though so be careful and avoid applying too much color on the brush prior to applying on nails. This polish also has a plumping agent to level out any imperfections on the nail. I found that 1 coat was all I needed.</p>

<DD>Full Size 10g, Value $22</DD>
</DL>

<p>The color 108 is a dusty rose pink color. This blush contains the mineral Mica which is light-reflecting and reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I don't have a lot of wrinkles or fine line on my cheeks, but the color suits me for a rosey natural look on my olive skin tone. And since this is full size, it will surely last for quite awhile.</p>

<DT>Biossance The Revitalizer</a></DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 4ml, Value $4.60 (Full Size 50ml, $58)</DD>
</DL>

<p>The Revitalizer contains their own plant-derived emollient, patented 100% Neossance Squalane. FYI, squalane is typically animal-derived so I was super relieved and happy to know that they have their own patented plant-derived version, phew!  It's also non-comedogenic, hypoallergenic, and paraben-free.</p>

<p>This rich ingredient hydrates and locks in essential moisture, leaving your skin feeling nourished and revitalized. I only used a couple of drops and applied on areas of my face that were dry. It did help and moisturize the area so this will surely be a life-saver for winter when I get patches of dry skin on my face that's so annoying.</p>

<DT>Julep - Luxe Up Your Lips in Sheer Coral</DT>
<DD>Full Size 12g., Value $24</DD>
</DL>

<p>Subscribers received different colors for this lip treatment/gloss and I love mine. It's a pink salmon coral color that goes on sheer and looks great on my tanned olive skin. It's moisturizing, not sticky and has only a bit of shimmer.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I liked the products in this month's box and will be using every single one of them. It's got a good mix of makeup and skincare plus a nail polish so it was an all around well balanced box that I can surely use. It also included 2 full-sized products so the value is definitely there for me too. That's what I love about Glossybox, besides their pretty packaging, they always include full-sized products that by itself is already worth more than the subscription. Can't wait to see what next month's box will bring!</p>
