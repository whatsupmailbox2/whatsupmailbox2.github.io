<p>I'm quite new to this subscription but have been loving it so far. It has really upgraded the jewelry that I wear and I find myself accessorizing more because of it!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rocksbox.com" target="_blank">Rocksbox</a> always sends out their jewels in these cute little boxes and enclosed with a ribbon. Once you're done using the jewelry and want to receive new ones, all you have to do is put them back into this box and ship it out with the padded envelope that it was in. Super easy and convenient!</p>

<p>They always include a personalized note with your name on it. Inside of this note is a list of items you received in this box and a note from your stylist as to why she chose them for you. (I completely forgot to take a pic of it this time!)</p>

<p>I also love the way they package it with this chic tissue paper, so fashionable and it adds to the unboxing experience.</p>

<DT><b>Kendra Scott</b> Rayne Necklace in Black</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $80 (Insider's Price $64)</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Size: 5.5“L x 1.125“W pendant on 30” chain with extender</i></p>

<p>I love Kendra Scott and I have quite a few of her pieces in my collection. This necklace is 14K gold plated over brass and the large charm on the end is made of black opaque glass. You can wear the necklace long or wrap it around twice for a shorter look.</p>

<p>I tend to wear a lot of black so this fits right in with pretty much most of what I wear. The gold tassle at the bottom also makes this necklace pop and will give any outfit a bit of glamour and bling. I love this necklace and am really contemplating on keeping this!</p>

<p>When I sent my last Rocksbox back, I also communicated with my stylist that I'd love to try on necklaces that are more bold in statement, so she gave me this to try out.</p>

<p>I wouldn't really call this bold (maybe just blingy) but I'm still happy to try this out. I wore it with a grey sweater and black skinny jeans and it looked great. I was going for a more rock chic style which this necklace can achieve depending on what you wear. I'm glad I got to try this out but I don't think it made my permanent list.</p>

<DT><b>Sophie Harper</b> Pavé Ball Studs in Gold</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $40 (Insider's Price $32)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I do love me some studs and these are classic enough to wear with anything. This will be great to wear with the Kendra Scott Rayne necklace since it's more delicate and won't clash too much with the necklace's more stated style.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This box was not as great as <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/coupons/Rocksbox-Jewelry-Subscription-Box-January-2016-Review-Coupon/" target="_blank">my previous one</a> but I did love (totally love) the Kendra Scott Rayne necklace so it wasn't a complete bust. The other 2 items were just okay and it did look good, it just didn't wow me. I'm going to communicate with my stylist to see if she can send me items that are more my style in the next box, and hopefully she can, fingers crossed. Stay tuned for my next review!</p>
