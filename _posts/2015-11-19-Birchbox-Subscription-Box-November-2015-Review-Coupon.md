<p>This month I chose their guest editor box which is the BIRCHBOX X GLAMLIFEGURU curated by YouTube beauty star Tati Westbrook. The design is simple but chic.</p>

<br>

<p>I received 5 items this month and because I chose the curated box, I knew exactly what I was going to get, but it was so long ago that I actually forgot what it was.</p>
<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT>LOC One & Done Shadow Stick in Day Trip</DT>
<DD>Full Size, Value $10 </DD>
</DL>

<p>I love eyeshadow sticks, they're so convenient and easy to use. Day Trip is a light gold shimmer color that will go great for the festive holidays. My only wish is that it was mechanical since I find sharpening them tends to waste product.</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT>Shiseido Ultimune Eye Power Infusing Eye Concentrate</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size .18 oz., Value $21.67 (Full Size .54 oz. $65)</DD>
</DL>


<p>This eye concentrate will help firm the skin around your eyes and also help with dark circles. I always incorporate an eye serum in both my morning and night skincare, so I will surely be using this.</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT>Jouer Lip Enhancer</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 4.5ml, Value $7.20 (Full Size 10ml. $16)</DD>
</DL>

<p>This balm not only moisturizes your lips, but it also helps minimize lines and increase fullness thanks to its Maxi-Lip™, an ingredient clinically proven to help naturally increase the fullness of your lips while decreasing fine lines. It has a glossy look to it, and although typically lip products that plump your lips would either sting or give out a tingly feeling, this one doesn't. I like it!</p>

<DL>
<DT>Living Proof Perfect Hair Day (PhD) Dry Shampoo</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 1.8 oz., Value $12 (Full Size 4 oz. $22)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I always need and use dry shampoos and I chose this curated box especially to get this! It was awarded Allure's Best of Beauty this year! I use quite abit of Living Proof products and love them, but I've never tried their dry shampoos before. It sprayed the powder evenly and although you see the white residue, you're supposed to wait 30 seconds then massage and shake your hair and its gone. I found that it was already gone within the 30 seconds even before I had to shake my hair. I love this product, it took out the oiliness and volumized my hair. Will be buying the full-sized version as soon as this runs out!</p>

<br>

<img src="/images/BirchboxNov2015AveneHydranceSerum.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Avène Hydrance Optimale Hydrating Serum" />
</a></center>

<DL>
<DT>Avène Hydrance Optimale Hydrating Serum</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 5ml., Value $6 (Full Size 30ml, $36)</DD>
</DL>

<p>Although I rarely use hydrating serums as I have oily/combination skin, the dry winter weather (or just plain dry since I live in California) does take its toll on my skin so I get some dry patches now and then. I used it only once so far and the gel-like formula went on smoothly and dried fast, and although it was too early to tell, I did feel somewhat more moisturized in the areas I applied this.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I knew exactly what I was receiving this month because I chose the curated box, and I'm glad I did. Every item will be used and I may be purchasing full-sized versions of some or all of them. The total value came up to $56.87 which is great for the $10 cost of this box. Even with a bad box the value has always still been there for me. I find Birchbox to be a great subscription to discover and try new products at the convenience of your own home and without talking to some beauty sales rep who may or may not be right. I recommend Birchbox to all my friends and it's no surprise that they end up subscribing right away =)</p>
