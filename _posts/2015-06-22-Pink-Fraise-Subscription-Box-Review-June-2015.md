<br>

<p>Pink Fraise is a new subscription box that just launched last month, and this June box is their first shipment.</p>

<p>I subscribed because its a lifestyle subscription and those are my favorite type! I was so excited to receive this box finally.</p>

<p>They ship their boxes through FedEx Ground and it took 4 days for it to arrive on my doorsteps in California.</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.gypsywitchmagick.com" target="_blank">Gypsy Witch Magick - Soy Candle in Honolua Bay</a></DT>
<DD>6 oz, Value $4.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>This 100% soy candle is fragranced with tiare flower and coconut. Tiare is a type of gardenia which grows in Tahiti and is the symbol of Tahiti as well. The scent is very floral and it smells amazing. I couldn't really smell any coconut in it which I prefer. Burning this candle definitely brings me back to my past visits to Hawaii and Tahiti where you could smell flowers such as these fragrantly empowering the air around you as you take an afternoon stroll. Oh man, I think I need to plan another visit soon!</p>

<DD>Value $2.45</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm sensing a Hawaiian theme here which I love, I'm an island girl at heart! This magnet is made with a 1 inch bottlecap and a Hawaiian girl design is then secured firmly to the bottle cap and sealed with a resin sticker.</p>

<p>Little Miss Made It sells items through Etsy and everything is handmade with a focus on quirky, vintage, kitsch and kawaii items. There's a ton of other designs for the magnets in the shop and it could make as cute little gifts.</p>

<DT><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/coragene" target="_blank">Cora's Creations - Golden Sun Juice SPF 30</a></DT>
<DD>2 oz., Value $6</DD>
</DL>

<p>This is another item from an Etsy shop and I couldn't find exact prices because the seller is on vacation so all her items are not accessible, but I did a quick search and the 4oz bottle is sold for $12 so I based my price value on that.</p>

<p>It's so hard to read anything below the name of the product on the label. I had to maximize my eyesight ability to read the ingredients and so far I could only read olive oil, coconut oil, and shea butter. I would say the scent is heavily shea butter and when I applied it on my skin, it seemed quite oily at first and did not absorb quickly, but once it did, it gave my skin a nice glow.</p>

<DL>
<DT><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/230948443/summer-soap-handcrafted-cold-process?ref=shop_home_active_6" target="_blank">Smart Soap - Summer Soap</a></DT>
<DD>2.5 oz. bar, Value $4</DD>
</DL>

<p>This soap is made with coconut milk then scented with a citrus blend and includes citronella to help keep those pesky mosquitoes away. It's made by using the cold process method and is cured for at least 4 weeks. They are dye free, synthetic fragrance free, preservative free and palm oil free!</p>

<p>I totally need this since for some reason mosquitoes love me, plus it'll be great for those summer camping trips. I'm ready for you mosquitoes!</p>

<DL>
<DT>Pearl Earrings by Pink Fraise</DT>
<DD>Value $4?</DD>
</DL>

<p>Since this was made by Pink Fraise and had no value stated on them, I estimated the price based on earrings sold with similar quality.</p>

<p>These were stated in the info card as handmade vintage pearl earrings exclusively from Pink Fraise. Well, they definitely look handmade and its definitely faux pearl. If you see my picture closely you can see some clear plastic strand coming out of it (it was actually longer but I managed to cut it shorter so it doesn't look too weird), so needless to say, this is my least favorite item in the box.</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Although I kind of expected more from their first launch box and was also hoping for more lifestyle items, I'll still be using everything in the box so I'm happy with that. I think if they included a cute and well made earring instead of the ones they sent out, it would have been a better box. The total value came up to $21.44 (using my estimate of the earrings) which almost made it even with the $21.99 cost of subscription. The value versus cost might not be great, but I'll give them another chance since this is their first launch box. Let's hope next month brings better products and value!</p>
