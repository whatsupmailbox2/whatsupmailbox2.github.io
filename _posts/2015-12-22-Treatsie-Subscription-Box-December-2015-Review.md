<DT><b>The Art Of Caramel</b> Brandy-Spiked Eggnog Caramel Popcorn</DT>
</DL>

<p>I'm a big fan of this brand and I was actually introduced to them by Treatsie in my <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Treatsie-Subscription-Box-Review-June-2105/" target="_blank">June 2015 Box</a>. This is a new flavor that they came out with for the holidays and boy oh boy does it taste good! Who can resist any popcorn that's brandy-spiked, it's such a treat for adults and will surely be a conversation maker if you ever decide to bring this to any party.</p>

<DT><b>Chuao Chocolatier</b> Holiday Chocopods Caramel Assortment</DT>
</DL>

<p>The flavors are Peppermint, Gingerbread, Caramel Apple Crush, and Cinnamon Cereal Smooch. They all sound yummy and I've had chocolates from this brand before and they taste great so I'm sure these will as well. If you're not into any of the flavors, these are quite small in size and would make great stocking stuffers.</p>

<DT><b>Malvi</b> Red Velvet Marshmallow Cookie Sandwhiches</DT>
</DL>

<p>Red Velvet is one of my favorite flavors so I was super excited to see this in the box! It's a red velvet sandwhich cookie with a good portion of marshmallow in between it. I literally had to stop myself from ripping it open right away before doing the review!</p>

<p>It's a pretty substantial size as you can see from the picture above, and it will look great on a cookie platter for the holidays. I'm not going to do that though, these are all going to my secret stash which is not for sharing! =P</p>

<DT><b>Avenue Sweets</b> Caramel Assortment</DT>
</DL>

<p>This caramel assortment includes Pecan (Brown), Sea Salt (Light Blue), Golden Vanilla (Yellow), Peppermint Chocolate (Red), and Sea Salt Chocolate (Blue). I like how they included different flavors and let me know which one they are by their colors in the info card. This way I don't have to guess or eat it all at once just to find a flavor I like. I'm not really a caramel lover, I eat it once in awhile, plus I've just had some dental work done so I'm to avoid anything chewy and sticky, so I think I'll put this in my candy jar that I display for guests to enjoy.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Minus the caramel, I loved it all. The items had a holiday feel to it and the type of sweets had a good variety for you to enjoy at home with loved ones or by yourself if you don't want to share ;) I especially loved the fact that they included The Art Of Caramel again, and in a new flavor too. And the Red Velvet Sandwhich Cookie, oh how amazing that was. I think I may need to buy more of those! I don't subscribe to them monthly, but when I feel it's time to try out some new sweets, I resubscribe and they haven't disappointed me in their shipments either. If you love trying out new type of sweets or treats, I highly suggest them.</p>

<p>If you want to try them out, you can <a href="http://fbuy.me/co5XW" target="_blank">subscribe here</a> and get Double the Sweets FREE with coupon code <a href="http://fbuy.me/co5XW">FRBUCO01</a>, that's double the sweets (Over $40 Total Value) when you subscribe today!</p>
