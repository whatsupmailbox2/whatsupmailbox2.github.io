<p>This box was designed to celebrate Birchbox customers as they celebrate their 5-year anniversary. The message is uplifting and the design is quite artistic. I'll be displaying this box on top of my vanity to remind me everyday that no matter what "you're beautiful" ;)</p>

<br>

**Benefit Cosmetics - Gimme Brow in Light/Medium (1g, Value $8)**
<p>I'm excited to try this since it promises to deliver fuller, darker brows that stay in place all day but still manages to look natural. That sounds perfect and I can't wait to see if this really works!</p>

**Dear Clark - Volumizing Tonic (1 fl.oz., Value $4.33)**
<p>This is handmade in Texas and as they say in Texas, go big or go home! And that must sound true for hair too which is why they've made this hair tonic treatment that will deliver enviable volume even to the flattest, finest strands. Well the last part applies to me so this will surely be used asap!</p>

**dr. brandt - Pores No More Cleanser (0.25 fl.oz., Value $2.50)**
<p>I am a fan of this cleanser. I have 2 full-sized tubes of this, plus a travel-sized one and now add this to the collection. I think I'm all set for now, lol. But honestly, this cleanser is amazing on my combination/oily skin and my face feels so fresh and so clean afterwards. I notice that I'm more matte and less oily throughout the day versus when I don't use it. Love this!</p>

**ModelCo - Ultra Long Lasting Lipstick (Full Size, Value $6.66)**
<p>Yay, lipstick! The color Smitten is a deep cranberry red, and as Coco Chanel said, "There is a shade of red for every woman" and this one goes on perfect for me!</p>

**Harvey Prince - Hello Perfume (Deluxe Sample Spray Vial 1.5 mL, Value $3)**
<p>I've received this sample in the past before and the fragrance is just not for me. It's too sweet and floral for my taste, so I'll have to pass this on.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Another great box from Birchbox! I'm not even sure which one I like better, this box or my first box I received earlier this month. It's so close. But if I had to look at value, I think my first box was higher, plus the fragrance sample in that one I actually liked. Either way, even if there's one or two items that I don't like, I find Birchbox still holds it value for me to continue subscribing. Especially since I can review each item I received and convert them to Birchbox dollars to spend, that's the best thing about this sub. I've made my sample choice for next month (I can't believe it's almost October already!) and can't wait for it to come to my mailbox already!</p>
