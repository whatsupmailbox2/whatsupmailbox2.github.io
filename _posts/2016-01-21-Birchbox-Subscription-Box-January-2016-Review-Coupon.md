<p>This month's box design celebrates a new year and a new resolution! I'm still thinking on what to put in that blank space, maybe "Monkey" in honor of the Chinese Year of Monkey ;)</p>

## Items in detail:

<img src="/images/BirchboxJan2016CleanCashmerePerfumeCiateNailPolish.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>CLEAN</b> Cashmere Eau de Parfum</DT>
<DD>Sample Vial 1ml, Value $1?</DD>
</DL>

<p>"This fragrance opens with bergamot, lime, cedar leaf and lavendin, and has middle and base notes that include mimosa, velvet jasmine, tonka bean, musk, and sandalwood."</p>

<p>So I'm not particularly in love with perfume samples, but I still welcome them as I've discovered great scents because of this in the past. This one though is not for me, plus I prefer my perfume sample in a spray vial so sadly this was a miss.</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT><b>Ciaté London</b> Nail Polish in Showgirl</DT>
<DD>Mini Paint Pot 5ml., Value $8</DD>
</DL>

<p>Yay, a nail polish! I always feel like I scored when I receive them in my Birchbox, but that's just me. The color Showgirl is a pinkish red base with red glitter specks. I've never been disappointed with Ciaté in the past so I know it's good. But unfortunately the glittery color is just not for me, so sadly this will be gifted which is a bummer cause I really wanted to keep it.</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>FOREO</b> Day Cleanser</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size, Value $4.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've heard of the FOREO cleansing tool and although the tool itself looks pretty unique, I'm a big fan of Clarisonic brushes so I'm staying loyal. It's kind of strange though that they included a cleanser that's specifically intended for use with a FOREO device, but I'll use this with my Clarisonic Mia2 and would think it'll be just the same, a cleanser is a cleanser.</p>

<img src="/images/BirchboxJan2016EyekoFatLiquidEyeliner.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Eyeko</b> Fat Liquid Eyeliner</DT>
<DD>Full Size 0.12 oz. / 3.5 g., Value $16</DD>
</DL>

<p>Black eyeliners are a staple so I'm always happy to receive one. This is a chubby eyeliner and I must confess, I don't have one of these types yet. I go with a cat eye look every now and then, so this will help in making a bolder and thicker line towards the ends of my eyes.</p>

<br>

<img src="/images/BirchboxJan2016TonyMolyTintDelight.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>TONYMOLY</b> Delight Tony Tint in #2 Red</DT>
<DD>Sample Size 3ml?, Value $2?</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>No sizes were stated on the packaging so the value is an estimate.</i></p>

<p>This lip tint smells nice and goes on smooth, but you definitely need to exfoliate your lips before applying as I found it to have a darker color on the areas that are dry or chapped. Once on, the color does stay on and doesn't transfer at all, so I'm happy with that. It is a very bright red and from what I see on their website, they only have 2 other colors for this lip tint, Cherry Pink and Orange Cha Cha. Good thing Birchbox sent me the Red one!</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Well, I'm not sure yet what to make of this month's box. Although the variety and type of items I received were good, it just seemed kind of blah to me, especially since one of my 5 items was a perfume sample vial. That is unfortunate, at least for me. But good thing I get to review my products and get $5 back to spend in the Birchbbox shop, so that makes this box worth it. $5 for a full-sized Eyeko eyeliner is a pretty good deal. I guess I need to update my profile and hope that next month's items will be better!</p>
