# Second Spoiler for Luxor Box!

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJuly2015SecondSpoiler.png"></center>

<p>I'm hoping for that awesome pitcher but it probably won't fit in the box so I'm guessing it'll be something smaller than that. Perhaps the coaster set?</p>

<p>They included a home accessory last time, a tea light (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Luxor-Box-May-2015-Review/" target="_blank">checkout my review of the last box here</a>), and I'm hoping this month it'll be bigger in size and more useful.</p>

<p>If you missed their first spoiler, here it is:</p>

<p>Not sure if they'll be releasing anymore spoilers, but if they do, I'll post it asap!</p>
