<DT><b>Elizabeth Cole</b> Adelia Cuff</DT>

<p>This bracelet was revealed prior to shipment and I was a bit undecided whether or not I like it even when I saw the spoiler, and now that I have it on hand, I'm still deciding if I like it or not. It does fit me (after a bit of an adjustment), but on the other hand, I don't find anything too special about the design and I certainly would not have paid full price for this. But all in all, it's a nice addition to the box, and who knows, maybe I'll like it more as I wear it more often.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the cuff:</p>

</a></center>
<br>

<p>The color of the gems are slate grey and they actually look dark so it can be used to accessorize any outfit.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>PRTTY Peaushun</b> Skin Tight Body Lotion</DT>
<DD>Value $39</DD>
</DL>

<p>This lotion's packaging is unique but not one that's aesthetically pleasing to me. I find it a bit of an odd way to dispense a body lotion, plus it just plainly doesn't look chic to me as well. This body lotion is supposed to both moisturize and make your body look good with its light reflecting minerals that blurs your imperfections. I'm not big on lotions that have any type of glitter or glittering objects, so this is kind of a miss for me. Hopefully I can gift it to someone who appreciates it more than I do.</p>

<p>This headband is so soft and lux, I am thrilled and in love with it! As the name suggests, it's made with 100% Cashmere and it will surely keep your ears warm and add a bit of fashion chic to your cold winter outfit. The color is a dark grey which I think is perfect. I may need to get more of these in different colors!</p>

<p>I like Butter London, I have a ton of their nail polishes but I never got around to trying out their liquid lipsticks so Thank You <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">Popsugar</a>, I can't wait to try each one of them out!</p>

<p>This set comes with 4 liquid lipsticks, and it features 2 exclusive colors. The colors are Fruit Cake (limited edition), Pudding (limited edition), Tea With The Queen, and Toff.</p>

<p>I've never used these type of candles before, but they do look quite chic and very large in size too. The design is white candles with silver dots, so it surely looks modern and chic and will go great with any decor.</p>

<p>I love how they included candle holders that fits the candles in this box, both in size and in style. Now I don't have to go shopping around for a holder that will fit the candles, phew!</p>

<p>Here's a look at the candle with the candle holder together:</p>

<p>I'm not too happy in getting fragrances in general from subscription boxes, but especially if it's from a Special Edition box. If they really had to include one, at least have one that's unique and special, and not one that seems sponsored and in a vial. Fragrances are such a specific preference, I really don't know why they included this and perhaps it really was sponsored hence no value was listed (I had to calculate based on the full size price). The notes on this perfume is Bulgarian Rose, Rose Centifolia, Raspberry, Bourgeon de Cassis, Pink Pepper, Saffron, Madagascar Vanilla, Patchouli, Vetiver, Jasmine, Magnolia. It's not my type of fragrance as I find it too sweet and fruity. Off it goes to be gifted.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Although I do like this box, I think it fell below my expectations and lacked in the "wow" factor for me. I absolutely loved the cashmere headband, definitely my favorite item in the box, and the Butter London lip glosses were nice as well, so those two items made this box valuable and worth it for me. It's hard to resist Special Edition boxes though, there have been great ones in the past so I'm sure I'll still be purchasing them. Just sadly this one was a bit of a disappointment and I hope <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">Popsugar</a> will make up for it in their next Special Edition box.</p>

<p>This box is a one-time purchase and is still available.
