<p>Not sure why, but the Flawless Skin Fluid box (green box on the right) was opened. Perhaps it was due to movement during shipping that made the box open. But not to fear, the moisturizer tube itself is sealed, so nothing to be worried about, phew!</p>

<p>Spoilers were released earlier for some items, but as always it's still exciting for me to actually finally have it in my hands.</p>

<figcaption>The info magazine</figcaption>
<br>

<p>This month <a href="http://xo.fff.me/cwUVT" target="_blank">FabFitFun</a> changed their info sheet into a magazine. I actually love it! It's very informational and they even modeled every item in the box so we can see how it's on/used. So very helpful!</p>

<p>Here are some pages from the info magazine:</p>

</a></center>

<br>

<p>I love how they tell the background of the company, tips on using the items and even some interviews with the artists behind the designs. So much better than their previous info sheets. Good job <a href="http://xo.fff.me/cwUVT" target="_blank">FabFitFun</a>!</p>

<br>

<H4>And here are the items inside:</H4>

</a></center>
<br>

<p>OMG, look at all the items in here! I think this is the most <a href="http://xo.fff.me/cwUVT" target="_blank">FabFitFun</a> has ever sent and even before I go into each item, I already can sense that this might be my favorite box from them yet!</p>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<DT>Gold Radiance Luxury Facial Mask With Collagen and Rose Oil by Passport to Beauty</DT>
<DD>2 masks, Value $65</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: The box comes sealed with stickers on both openings</i><p>

<p>I'm a mask junkie so everytime I find them in my sub boxes, I'm already thrilled and happy. This mask is specially formulated with luxurious colloidal gold along with collagen to promote your skin’s natural beauty. The surface of the mask is coated with a gold essence and infusion of Rosa Damascena, a fragrant, pink-flowering plant that yields rose petals that provide the precious rose essential oil, regarded to be more precious than gold.</p>

<p>It's very luxurious indeed... 2 masks for $65, um yeah, I'm gonna save this for when I really want to treat myself with a home spa. It'll have to be accompanied by some Veuve Clicquot champagne, Rose French Macarons and I'll light up my Jo Malone candle with Michael Bublé singing in the background. Yep, I'll be going the whole nine yards with this!</p>

<DT>FabFitFun x Tappan Collective Umbrella in <i>Pink</i></DT>
<DD>Value $32</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Subscribers received one of these colors: Pretty in Pink, Sky Blue, Classic Black, Mango Tango or Sunshine Yellow</i></p>

<p>The artist is LA-based so that already got my attention. Plus I love pink! Although it doesn't rain much in LA, a cute umbrella is always welcomed. The design has prints that say "Rain Rain Go Away" all over, so ah-dorable.</p>

<DT>Lucky Lip Stain by Manna Kadar Cosmetics</DT>
<DD>Value $24</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: The box comes sealed with stickers on both openings</i></p>

<p>I've used Manna Kadar lip products before thanks to <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> and I do like them. Their ingredients are natural and this 3-in-1 lip product is a combination of a primer, lip gloss, and lip stain all-in-one! It moisturized my lips and although it's a lip gloss, there was very minimal shine which I love. It definitely gave me a dewy rosey natural lip look. Love it!</p>

<DT>Flawless Skin Fluid by Doctor D. Schwab</DT>
<DD>Value $39</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: The tube comes sealed</i></p>

<p>I've never heard of this brand but am excited to try it. Not only does it moisturize, but it also smoothes and visually corrects uneven skin tone caused by age spots and hyperpigmentation. My summer days of laying by the pool and beach has given my face some hyperpigmentation, so I am in need of this. The ingredients are also all-natural which is always a plus in my book.</p>

<p><i>Note: The box for this battery comes sealed with stickers on the top opening only</i></p>

<p><i>Subscribers received one of these colors: Berry + Rose, Mint + Lavender or Aqua + Navy</i></p>

<p>I actually don't have a battery pack. I never found a need for it, but now that I have one in hand, I'm sure I'll be thinking to myself "why did I never use this before!" lol.</p>

<center><a href="http://xo.fff.me/cAIsf" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/FabFitFunFall2015Battery2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="HISY Battery Pack" />
</a></center>

<p>Although their info magazine shows this battery pack hooked up to an iPhone using the included USB cable, the other end is a micro USB which does not work on iPhones so I'm not sure why it's shown that way. You have to use your own iPhone charging cable which is not a big deal. The included cable can then be used to charge the actual battery pack.</p>

<p>There is a power button on the side, and when you do turn it on, there's a bright blue strip of light that will start flashing continuously on the front of the battery pack. You can see the light on the picture above (it took a lot of tries for me to catch a picture with that light flashing!).</p>

<p>HISY also included a 25% off coupon which I'm sure I'll be using soon.</p>

<DT>Strength Tubing Ankle & Total Body Tone DVD by Merrithew</DT>
<DD>1 Tube & 1 DVD, Value $33</DD>

<p>I love it when <a href="http://xo.fff.me/cwUVT" target="_blank">FabFitFun</a> sends out fitness products, it motivates me to get back on track with my fitness goals.</p>

</a></center>

<p>I actually have this tube already! You can even <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/products/reviews/Merrithew-Tubing-Ankle-Plus-DVD-Review/" target="_blank">read my short review of it here</a>. I purchased it earlier this year and shipping is quite expensive since they are a Canadian company, so I'm happy to get another one without that hassle!</p>

<p>This tube is very easy to use and boy does it work your quads out. You can of course use it for toning other parts of your body depending on the exercises you do, but they are a great addition to your workout tools and one that I cannot live without now. The DVD that comes in this set is also very helpful and helps you utilize the tube to its full potential. I know this because the DVD I bought with my tube earlier this year is the exact same one!</p>

<DT>Glass Crystal Bead Bracelet by Tribe Alive</DT>
<DD>Value $49</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Subscribers received one of these colors: Aquamarine, Mexican Blue, White Jade or Grey Jade</i></p>

<p>Yay, a jewelry item! I loved the necklace they included in the Summer Box (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/FabFitFun-Subscription-Box-Summer-2015-Review-Coupon/" target="_blank">read my review here</a>), so I was hoping for another jewelry piece. This bracelet is what I would consider boho chic, and it is pretty, but I'm not sure I would have bought it at $49. But it does go towards a good cause as Tribe Alive partners with artisans all over the world to employ impoverished women by providing them with a sustainable income.</p>

<br>

<p>I love the Aquamarine color, it's so very calming and pretty on my tanned skin. I think it will look good stacked with the white one too so I may have to try to get a hold of that one as well!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> One word, WOW! There were so many items they included in this box and all of them were such a hit too! It had a great mix of different types of products and I think this is definitely my favorite box from them as of yet. I also love that they changed their info sheets to a magazine now, that was such a great move. With a total value of $366.99 (that's 7 times more than the cost of this subscription!), this is an absolute must have if you're looking to subscribe to a subscription box, especially if you're into cool and trendy products!
