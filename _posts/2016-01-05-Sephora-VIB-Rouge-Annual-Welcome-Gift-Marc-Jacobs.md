<p>Sephora VIB Rouge is a status you earn when you purchase $1000 or more in a calendar year. You'll receive benefits such as an exclusive VIB Rouge Welcome Gift, always Free Shipping with no miminum amount, exclusive gifts with purchases, private shopping events, concierge phone line, etc, etc.</p>

<p>In order to maintain your status, you need to requalify and make the amount of purchase again every year, and when you do so, you get another VIB Rouge Welcome Gift. Every year they come up with a new welcome gift and last year, 2015, it was a Marc Jacobs Le Marc Lip Crème in So Rouge (exclusive, limited-edition). I always end up purchasing a lot during the holidays so I'm a bit late in renewing my VIB Rouge status and just received my gift last week.</p>

<p>The welcome kit includes the lipstick, a VIB Rouge Red Card (if it's your first time to qualify, if it's a renewal you don't get another red card), and a Beauty Studio All-Access Pass (not pictured).</p>

<p>The packaging is beautiful and it feels like I'm part of an exclusive club alright ;)</p>

<p>The size is mini-sized and perfect for travelling or to carry in a pretty little clutch. Marc Jacobs Le Marc Lip Crème is a rich, velvety, ultra-hydrating lipstick that delivers dramatic, vivid pigment and 10 hours of luxurious wear. This lipstick is typically housed in a black casing, but this red casing is exclusive only to this color and for VIB Rouge members which I think is so awesome and gorgeous, it will definitely stand out in my makeup bag and when I take it out to reapply my lip color!</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the lipstick:</p>

<p>The color So Rouge is an exclusive color for VIB Rouge members only, and it's limited edition as well. It's a great shade of red that's oh-so sexy and très chic, I can't wait to wear it with one of my Little Black Dresses!!!</p>
