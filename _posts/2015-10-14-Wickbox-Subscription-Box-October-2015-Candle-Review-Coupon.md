<p>They included a thank you note on top, but I'm not sure if every subscriber received this.</p>

<p>The box was packed with these white and gold fillings, like really packed. I had to dig dig dig through this and finally find the item at the bottom of the box.</p>

<p>Finally, the item has appeared! I love that Wickbox includes dust bags with their candles, such a luxurious and personal touch! I will surely use this when I travel with my candles.</p>
<br>

<H4>And here is the candle I received in full glory:</H4>

<p>The candle was sealed on top with plastic so the scent can remain fresh until it's in your hands and you're ready to use it.</p>

<p>The wax is a vegetable-based candle wax and it has 50 hours of burning time. The other ingredients are: clove oil, damask rose oil, food grade dye, lemon oil, lily of the valley oil, and peony oil.</p>

<p>This candle is quite unique in which its topped with real scented petals, which can be emptied into a small dish to subtly scent a room or put in a hot bath. See more close-up pictures below.</p>

<p>I've set some aside and used it to scent my office for now and it smells great! I've never had candles like these before so I'm super happy and can't wait to use it in my next bath too!</p>

<p>One thing to note though, and this is outside of the quality or actual review of the product, is that Peony can be toxic to dogs or cats. I learned this the hard way as I burned some Peony candles before in my bedroom where my little Yorkie sleeps with me and he had a really bad cough and runny nose the next day. Peony if ingested can cause more serious danger, but just a side note for those of you with four-legged babies.</p>

<p>Some important instructions and cautions on burning this candle to take note of. I always trim the wick before lighting up any candle, so if you haven't done so, try doing that from now on and your candles will last longer.</p>

<br>

<p>The candle itself is not as big as I expected, so to give you a comparison, I've lined it up with my other 2 candles that's in my office.</p>

<p>They included an Info Card that gives a brief summary of the candle you received. The first one on top is for the Large Box (although I wish I got that gold one, so gorgeous!), and the bottom one is for the Medium Box.</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I'm pleased with the candle I received and it was quite unique with the real scented flower petals inside of it to use for other purposes. This subscription is absolutely something that I've been waiting for and needed in the subscription world as there are not much luxury candle boxes out there for us to subscribe to, so it's a great addition. This candle is valued at $38 and the subscription cost for the Medium Box is $29.95 + $5 shipping, so it pretty much almost broke even. The Large Box had an $85 value candle (I read another blogger's review that received that box) and the price for the subscription is $39.95 + $5 shipping. With that fact, I would probably subscribe to the Large Box as it'll give you more value (almost double!) and burning time, plus perhaps a more luxurious candle jar. It's also a great gift idea for the candle lover, or even someone who loves luxury items. Personally, I'd be ecstatic if someone gifted this subscription to me! =)</p>
