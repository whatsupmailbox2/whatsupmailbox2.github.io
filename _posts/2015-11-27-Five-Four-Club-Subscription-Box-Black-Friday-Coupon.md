<H4>What's Five Four Club?</H4>

<p><b>What do you get:</b> Five Four Club is a monthly menâ€™s clothing subscription. Each month you'll receive an apparel package (2-3 items) valued at $120 or more that's selected according to your style profile and preferences.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fivefourclub.com/getstarted?referrer=RE731318" target="_blank">Five Four Club</a> is a great subscription for men who don't have time to shop or need the extra fashion help to bump up their wardrobe. I find their products to be of high quality and their style on trend.</p>

<p>When you subscribe, you'll take a profile survey to input your size and style preferences. You can retake the questionnaire at anytime to change your style, I do it every so often depending on the items I received that month so I can mix up the type of clothing I get.</p>

<p>I highly recommed this subscription for that special man in your life ;)</p>
