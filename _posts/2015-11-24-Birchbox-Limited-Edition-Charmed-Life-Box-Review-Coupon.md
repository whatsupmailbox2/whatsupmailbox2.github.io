<p>The packaging is always different when you're receiving non-subscription items, but I was still surprised as I've never seen this design before. So winter festive!</p>

<br>

<p>When you open the package, you see your Limited Edition box tucked under some bubble wrap. I see a small package next to it and I'm guessing that's the Mystery Sample Pack items, can't wait to see what that is too!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Canvas Home</b> Dauville Bud Vase</DT>
<DD>Value $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>Petite vases make a great addition to any room and will fit any single our double flower buds. I especially love the combination of white and gold, my favorite combo ever!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Illume</b> Demi Vanity Tin Candle in Anemone & Matchbox</DT>
<DD>Candle Value $10, Matchbox Value $4</DD>
</DL>


<p>I have these travel-sized candles already in different scents, and no matter what scent they are, it's always been a hit for me. Every box will have a different scent and I received Anemone, which is described as a blend of apple mint, citrus, and patchouli. They have a clean burn and how cute is the matchbox that they included as well. Such a great addition to this box.</p>

<br>

</a></center>

<p>Even though it's travel-sized, I love how the packaging still allows for the candle to be closed (and it does close tightly) so that if you need to take it travelling with you again, it'll be messy and hasle free.</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Isaac Jacobs</b> Sunburst Picture Frame</DT>
<DD>Value $20?</DD>
</DL>

<p>This picture frame was made exclusively for Birchbox therefore I had to estimate the value based on other similar frames being sold on Amazon.</p>

<p>Gold frames are a favorite of mine and it's evident all around my house. It's a simple way to add some sophistication and glamour into your house without overdoing it. The design on this frame will add some texture to your decor which can make a big difference if most of your decor items have clean lines. Put this next to your simple rectangular frame and voila, you will add some much needed texture in your space.</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>NUXE</b> Huile Prodigieuse Oil</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 10ml, Value $5.80</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm not big on applying oil onto my skin, I'm just too sensitive plus my face is already somewhat oily so that's a big no no for me. This oil is made with six different essential oils that will hydrate your skin and give it a sheen altogether. I've heard good reviews about this and do wish I could use it especially since I love Nuxe and have some of their products. Oh well, I'm sure I can find someone who will be more than happy to use this.</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT><b>Stephanie Johnson</b> Folding Mirror</DT>
<DD>Value $24?</DD>
</DL>

<p>This mirror was made exclusively for Birchbox as well, so I estimated the value based on another compact snap mirror they have on their website that's selling for $24.</p>

<p>This is such a great item to travel with and perfect for me as I do travel quite a bit. Not all hotels have mirrors that are strategically positioned so that I can put on my makeup comfortably, and that's where this folding mirror will come in handy. Can't wait to use this for my New Year's vacay!</p>

<p>Here's another look at the mirror from the side:</p>

<p>The size is travel-friendly and it folds flat, what more can I ask for.</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>TOCCA</b> Crema Da Mano (hand cream) in Cleopatra</DT>
<DD>2 oz., Value $10</DD>
</DL>

<p>FYI, this hand cream came sealed. I've had TOCCA lotions before and loved them, so I was happy that they included this in the box. Cleopatra is a grapefruit and cucumber infusioin scent that smells sweet and refreshing. It's also paraben-free and enriched with natural extracts from coconut oil, shea butter and aloe. I am bringing this everywhere with me from now on!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Umbra</b> Geo T Ring Holder</DT>
<DD>Value $10</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love love Umbra. I've incorporated so many of their products into my home decor, they're just that good. What I love most about them is their simple clean designs yet it packs in convenience and usability. This ring holder is just that. It's both simple, elegant and yet very functional.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the ring holder:</p>
<center><a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/BirchboxCharmedLifeUmbraRingHolder2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Umbra Geo T Ring Holder" />
</a></center>

<p>It fits my rings perfectly and the shape of the rod itself is a hexagon so your rings don't keep sliding when you put them on there.</p>

<p>And a side view of the ring holder:</p>
<center><a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/BirchboxCharmedLifeUmbraRingHolder3.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Umbra Geo T Ring Holder" />
</a></center>

<p>You can see more of the hexagon shape and also how my rings stand faceup on this rod. If it was circle, they would just be all face down and unattractive to display. So yeah, this ring holder is amazing and will definitely look gorgeous on any table. Love it!</p>

<figcaption>Pura Vida Headband & Temple Spa Hair Conditioner</figcaption>

<br>

<p>For my Mystery Sample Pack, this time I received a headband from Pura Vida and a conditioner from Temple Spa. Although I already have the same exact headband from a previous mystery sample pack, having another won't hurt and I prefer getting that than another skincare or makeup sample. I've never received the conditioner before so that was a nice addition.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I think this is the best Limited Edition box Birchbox has ever come out with, especially when you're comparing the price you pay versus the value you receive, definitely a winner! As I mentioned earlier, I knew I would love this box as soon as they released news about it, and I was right. Not only do I love it, I love it so much I immediately purchased another box after unboxing this one. Yeah, I have a shopping addiction, I'm aware of it. But seriously, I think this box will not only be good for a much needed gift for yourself, it will be a fantastic box to gift to others as well. You will surely be their MVP (Most Valuable Person) from then on ;)</p>
