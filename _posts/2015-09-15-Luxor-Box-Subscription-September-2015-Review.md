<p>This bracelet was revealed last month as an item in the box, but it was so long ago that I actually forgot about it. I love the design - simple, clean and chic - and I also LOVE that it's gold. Well, to be exact, it's 18k vermeil which means it's 925 sterling silver plated with Gold.</p>

<figcaption>Closer look at the bracelet</figcaption>
<br>

<p>With a value of $268, this bracelet is quite a gem. I would never have purchased this myself especially at that price, but that's why I subscribe to these boxes since now I can have it without spending that dough!</p>

<p>When I did try it on, for some reason it was scratching my hands, like there were some sharp edges. Turns out the ends of the bracelet where you insert your hand was either knicked off or slight pieces broke off and that created sharp edges. I emailed Luxor Box right away and they replied the next day (I emailed at night) with instructions on how to mail it back to them and once they receive it they'll mail out a replacement as soon as possible. I do hope it won't take too long because I love this bracelet and can't wait to use it!</p>

<p>There are 4 variations in color that subscribers will receive.

Although I do have blue in my decor, it's more of a tourquise blue so I'm not sure that this will fit. And the size is too small for my taste so sadly this item was a pass for me.</p>

<p>There was a Pura Botanica makeup pouch in the last Luxor Box (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Luxor-Box-Subscription-July-2015-Review/" target="_blank">you can read my review of it here</a>), so I was surprised to see this brand again this time around. Subscribers received either this set, Body Lotion & Cleanser, or the Shampoo & Conditioner set.</p>

<p>The cleanser is made with Organic Aloe and Shea Butter that works to cleanse and moisturize the skin, while the added Jojoba Seed Oil washes away any dead skin. The scent is minty fresh which I love and I can't wait to use this in the shower.</p>

<p>The lotion is made with Avocado Oil to reduce skin inflammation and redness, antioxidant-rich Coconut Oil to provide deep moisture, and Cocoa Seed Butter to prevent dry skin. The scent is minty fresh as well and I love that they included a pouch for these two bottles, will definitely come in handy when I travel.</p>

<p>I'm so glad I got the body lotion and cleanser versus the hair set. I tend to be a bit picky on what I use for my hair. With all the lotions I've been getting lately in my subscription boxes, winter has nothing on me!</p>

<p>This brand was also in my previous Popsugar box, but it was a difusser that smelled oh-so-good! So of course I'm happy that I received another product by them.</p>

</a></center>

<p>As soon as I opened the box, I noticed an amazing scent and now I know, this is it! It's a scent of sweet minerals with vanilla and musk in a green glass tumbler. It smells sweet yet fresh and slightly woody. Love it!</p>

<p>Made with soy wax and cotton wick, this is surely my type of candle and I absolutely adore the glass jar and will be reusing it once the candle is gone.</p>

<p>I can never have enough lip balms or lip products for that matter. This one is very moisturizing and not only is it good for your lips, you can also use this on dry areas such as hands, elbows, heels and anywhere else that requires moisturization.</p>

<p><i>Ingredients: Organic Persea Americana (Avocado) Oil, Organic Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Organic Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Fruit, Organic Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E).</i></p>

<p>You can definitely smell the cocoa butter, which I don't mind, and the texture is so velvelty soft and creamy. I used it on my dry lips today and it definitely felt moisturized after applying this on.</p>

<p>What an interesting item. It's supposed to be a pad for you to jot your ideas or anything you need to write at a moment's notice. It comes with 100 heavy weight cream cards as well as a heavy card stock carrying case that fits nicely into pockets or handbags. It features a fleur-de-lis motif in raised taupe ink. I'm not sure I'll be using this as I have so many notepads that I use instead (this is too small for my big handwriting), so I might gift it.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Hmmm, I'm not sure I'm in love with this box, it just wasn't "luxor" enough for me. I had an issue with the bracelet which is not a good sign of quality from that brand (nothing against Luxor Box), the vase was meh, and the idea catcher from eInvite just seemed like an odd item to put in a high-priced box. I'm still happy with most of the items and of course I'll continue to subscribe because it's still worth it to me even minus the vase and idea catcher. I would love to see Luxor Box collaborating with jewelry brands such as (cough cough) Miansai, or maybe Kendra Scott? Am I wishing too high? ;) Well here's to hoping the next box will be more "luxor" for me.</p>

Currently all subscriptions are sold out, so you will most likely join a waiting list, but don't worry, it typically opens up prior to the next shipment. But be on the lookout, boxes are limited so you'll have to subscribe while supplies last.</p>
