![Treatsie Box Ruelala](/images/TreatsieRuelalaMay2015.jpg)
<p><b>Subscription:</b><a href="http://www.treatsie.com"> Treatsie Box</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $15 / month + $4.95 shipping</p>
<p><b>Deal:</b> Purchase on <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox">Rue La La</a></p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> An assortment of gourmet sweets from vendors all over the country. 
3 different vendors every month and up to $25 worth of gourmet sweets per box.</p>

<p>Here are the prices on <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox">Rue La La</a>:
<ul>
<li>1 month $14.99 (reg. 19.95)</li>
<li>3 months $39 (reg. $42)</li>
</ul>

<p>*Note: Shipping is not included and you will be enrolled in their monthly subscription box after your purchased period. If you don't want to continue, you may cancel through your online account.</p>

<p>I'm not sure this is a good deal and I don't know why Ruelala states that Treatsie's 1-month subscription is regularly $19.95 when it's $15. It is $19.95 if you include shipping, but Ruelala doesn't include shipping either so it ends up being the same price.</p>

<p>If you do want to try this out, definitely buy the 3-month subscription to save some $$$.</p>
