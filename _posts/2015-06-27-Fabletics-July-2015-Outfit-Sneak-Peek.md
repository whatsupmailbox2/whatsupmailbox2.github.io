<p>I'm not so sure about the Kawela Bay outfit since I don't really wear skirts to workout or play tennis that often. But, I am loving that Lahaina outfit and it's also sentimental since I've actually been to Lahaina (in Maui). It's a great place to vacation and wind down, plus you get to see the Hawaiian Green Sea Turtles on the beaches there! I'm totally getting this outfit, it's a must.</p>
