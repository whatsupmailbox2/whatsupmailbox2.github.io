<p><b>What's in the box:</b> One FULL SIZED beauty product that's matched to your "Beauty Profile" that you complete upon signing up.</p>
<br>

<p>This is my second box from Beauty DNA so I was intrigued to see what they matched me with this month!</p>

<p>Oooh, an Eye Report is my match for this month, I wonder what it is?!</p>
<br>

<p>I purchased a deal from <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Ruelala</a> (it's no longer available) a couple of months back and this is my second shipment from that deal. Checkout my blog frequently as I post deals on subscription boxes whenever they're available =)</p>

<p>Beauty DNA is a completely different experience than other beauty subscriptions. They send out one full-sized product that's matched with your skin concerns or needs. When you join, there's a "Beauty Profile" (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/Beauty-DNA-August-2015-Review/" target="_blank">you can see my August review where I explain their Beauty Profile</a>) that you need to complete and this is how they match you with your product. It didn't take me long at all to complete it and I also like the fact that you can access your Beauty Profile anytime and modify it if you ever have any changes in your skincare needs.</p>

<H4>Based on my Beauty Profile, here is the item they matched me with:</H4>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Lash.jpg'></center></p>

<DL>
<DT>Hydroxatone Lashatone</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size 1 ml, Value $50</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've tried this brand before but was not aware that they had treatments for lashes too. It's supposed to make your lashes appear significantly longer and thicker in only a few weeks. I've used Latisse before with good results so I'm curious to see how this compares.</p>

<p>Application was similar to Latisse in which you apply it on like an eyeliner. But with Latisse you use disposable brushes while Lashatone has a built-in applicator. I'm not sure if I like the first or the latter due to sanitary reasons, but we shall see. FYI, this product is not available on their website anymore, it states that it's sold out which I hope is true versus being discontinued.<p>
<br>

<p>Beauty DNA also included a detailed Beauty Report about the product and why they matched it for you.</p>
<br>

<H2><i class="icon-gift"></i> Bonus Item:</H2>

<p>Because I purchased this Beauty DNA subscription through <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Ruelala</a>, the deal also included one extra product with every box. So here's my bonus product:</p>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Hair.jpg'></center></p>

<DL>
<DT>Keratherapy - Keratin Infused Rapid Rescue</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size 125ml, Value $24</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've never heard of this brand before. It's a finishing product that's supposed to transform dull, dry hair to shiny, smooth and healthy. I like that it can be used on both damp or dry hair. I used it this morning after towel drying my hair and just let it air dry after. The scent is sweet and refreshing and application with the spray was even, but there were times where the product leaked on my hand instead of spraying it on my hair. So for the results, I did notice smoother and shinier hair which is great for my frizzy and dry ends. I think I need to use it more often to see how it compares to my other leave-in conditioners.</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I like Beauty DNA and I think the value is definitely still there for me, but this month was kind of a miss. I loved last month's products, so maybe it's also because it's hard to follow up after such a great box. I've used both items already and will continue to use them until they're finished up, so at least that's good. And for $25, these two items are definitely still a deal for me. I think I need to update my beauty profile to see if I get better results next month.</p>
