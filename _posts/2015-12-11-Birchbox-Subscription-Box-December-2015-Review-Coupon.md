<p>This month's box design is festive and wintery, appropriate for December. I think it's a bit lackluster though and kind of blah, but that's just my opinion and personal taste.</p>

<p>When it was time for sample selections last month, I decided not to select any and just let Birchbox surprise me. So I'm at least eager to see what I got in this box.</p>

<p>For reference, here's the sample choice you could choose last month for this box:</p>

<br>

<p>I received 5 items this month and I'm not sure if it's because I chose not to select my sample last month, but I ended up receiving 2 of the items listed in their sample choices, how awesome is that!</p>
<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT>(MALIN+GOETZ) Clarifying Clay Mask</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 15ml, Value $7.20 </DD>
</DL>

<p>This mask treats oiliness and blemishes. Formulated for acne-prone skin but safe enough for sensitive, it contains refined kaolin clay to help absorb excess oil and draw out impurities, plus pumice to polish away dead skin. Anti-bacterial witch hazel and anti-inflammatory arnica extract add calming and cleansing powers to achieve matte, breakout-free skin. This mask is perfect for my skin and I'm so happy I received this, Birchbox really knows me!</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT><b>Yu-Be</b> Moisturizing Skin Cream</DT>
<DD>Sample Size 3ml., Value $1.28</DD>
</DL>


<p>I currently still have 2 of these samples, I seem to be getting them from different sources lately. I'm not a big fan, but I don't dislike it either. I'll be tossing this in my supply box with the other samples for future need. This moisturizer is free of artificial dyes and fragrances, so it'll be great for sensitive skin.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Coastal Scents</b> styleEYES Eyeshadow Palette in formalEYES</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size, Value $3</DD>
</DL>

<p>This is one of the items that you can choose as your sample. There were 3 palettes to choose from; formalEYES, glamourEYES, or socialEYES.</p>

</a></center>

<p>I received formalEYES which is a combination of a light nude color and a dark shimmer copper color. I like the combination, it's a universally flatering color that will suit any skintone.</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Serge Normant</b> Dream Big Instant Volumizing Spray</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 1.8 oz., Value $15</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm always down for bigger and fuller hair. Unfortunately I wasn't born with it, so I welcome all the tools to help me achieve that.</p>

<p>I sprayed this on my dry hair and almost instantly it gave me volume without having to do much. I have really long hair so the heavy weight might play a part in decreasing the volume. I'm guessing if you have short(er) hair you might achieve much more volume. Either way, I'm loving this spray, so much that I purchased the full size right away and I used the $10 coupon included in this box too, how convenient!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>theBalm</b> Cosmetics FratBoy Blush</DT>
<DD>Sample Size, Value $3?</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>No sizes were stated on the packaging so the value is an estimate.</i></p>

<p>I received a bronzer sample from theBalm before in the same exact size and style of packaging. It is tiny so I'm not sure if I can use this effectively as I do tend to use big blush brushes. But I guess I can use my fingers or a small contouring brush, that should do the trick.</p>

<img src="/images/BirchboxDec2015TheBalmFratBoy2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="theBalm Cosmetics FratBoy Blush" />
</a></center>

<p>The color of this blush is a light pink rose that has a slight shimmer to give you that natural glow look.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I'm happy with the items I received this month. The mask fits my skin's needs to the tee and my favorite find is hands down the Serge Normant volumizing spray. The eyeshadow palette and blush, although tiny, are much appreciated as well and I will be using them nevertheless. Plus I received a $10 off a $35 purchase coupon, which like all other coupons they ever sent me, <strike>will be used</strike> has been used. Time to review my products in my Birchbox account so I can receive $5 back, which equals to more shopping!</p>
