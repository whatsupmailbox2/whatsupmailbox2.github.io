<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="https://adorebox.cratejoy.com" target="_blank">Adore Box</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $15 / month + Free Shipping</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> Every month you'll receive 4-7 beauty and lifestyle products.</p>
<br>

<p>This is my first Adore Box and I subscribed because it had lifestyle products, and I love those type of subscriptions so I just had to try it out.</p>

<p>When I first saw this package on my doorsteps, I was baffled as to where it came from since it had no markings besides the shipment label. And even that doesn't say Adore Box. See below picture of the box.</p>

<p>See what I mean. But after I opened the box, of course the first thing I saw was the info sheet with Adore Box displayed on top. Mystery solved.</p>

<p>The info card:</p>

<p>I'm kind of disappointed to see that their info card was printed on a regular paper and folded in half, it gives it a cheap feeling and I'm already thinking to myself "if the info card is cheap, what will the products be?"</p>

<br>

<DT>And here are the products inside:</DT>

<center><img src='/images/AdoreBoxJune2015Mascara.jpg'></center>

<DL>
<DT>MAC - False Lashes Mascara</DT>
<DD>Small Sample Tube, Value $2?</DD>
</DL>

<p>This sample is tiny and I actually get these type of mascara samples for free from Sephora or other beauty stores, so it was quite disappointing.</p>
<p>The mascara itself is alright, not my favorite since it really doesn't curl or lengthen my eyelashes as much as other brands do. I probably won't be buying this in full size anytime soon.</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/AdoreBoxJune2015Eyeshadow.jpg'></center>

<DL>
<DT>Wet N Wild - Color Icon Eyeshadow Trio</DT>
<DD>Full Size, Value $2.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've never owned or tried Wet N Wild products before and I probably won't be using this one either. I know its a drugstore brand and I'm okay with some of them, but Wet N Wild just seems too high school for me so I'm not happy to be getting this in a subscription box. Ugh, another disappointing item, can this get any worse.</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/AdoreBoxJune2015WashItems.jpg'></center>

<DL>
<DT>Bath & Body Works - Aromatherapy Body Wash</DT>
<DD>Sample Size, $2?</DD>
</DL>

<p>Okay, I can live with this brand and product, finally something that's acceptable. The scent is refreshing and invigorating, perfect as a body wash and will be great for when I'm traveling next month for my vacation.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Listerine - Zero Mouthwash</DT>
<DD>Sample Size, Value $1?</DD>
</DL>

<p>What an odd thing to receive in a subscription box that describes itself as a beauty and lifestyle box. Although I can surely use this, I'm not yet quite sure on how I feel about receiving it. Hmmm.</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/AdoreBoxJune2015Acne.jpg'></center>

<DL>
<DT>Comedone Extractor with Lance</DT>
<DD>Value $5.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm using the value they stated since there's no branding or info on where it came from, but the actual item itself feels like it could have come from a 99 cents store. Although I do need one of these to add to my skincare tools, I'm not so sure I'll be using this item per say due to the quality of it. But who knows, I might just give it a try.</p>
<br>

<center><img src='/images/AdoreBoxJune2015Cutler.jpg'></center>

<DL>
<DT>Cutler Body Milk</DT>
<DD>Value $6</DD>
</DL>

<p>Again, I'm using the value they stated since I couldn't find this brand at all. But what I did find is that the company that produces it is called Erwyn and when I looked at their website, it turns out that they're a Hotel Industryâ€™s supplier of guest room and guest bathroom accessories as well as personal guest amenities. That was a shock. So most likely this item is found in a hotel room somewhere, complimentary. Ugh, disappointing again.</p> 
<br>

<center><img src='/images/AdoreBoxJune2015Packets.jpg'></center>

<DL>
<DT>Raw Elements - Eco Sunscreen SPF 30</DT>
<DD>2 packets, Value $.50? each</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm never happy when I receive sample packets especially when its included as one of the box items, and this one stands true. The product itself seems like a great sunscreen to try out, and I'm sure I will since the ingredients are natural with zinc oxide so that part is great. I just wish it wasn't in sample packets.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Urgent RX - Headache Relief To-Go</DT>
<DD>1 packet, Value $.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>This is a headache relief product that's in a form of powder and you take it as it is -directly poured into your mouth. I'm not so sure that's convenient versus a pill, I'm imagining powder splattered all over the face if you don't pour it right. Because this product has caffeine in its ingredient, I won't be able to try it out unless its early in the morning cause I have sensitivity with caffeine. I think I prefer my medicine in tablet form for the sake of convenience.</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I hate writing bad reviews but this one was really disappointing, especially since its my first box with them. And frankly, I'm a little confused as to what this subscription is supposed to be. Its got drugstore brands, sample packets and a blemish lancer, so random. Without counting the blemish lancer and eyeshadow, the rest of the items seems like something I would get for free when I check into a hotel, that's not good. I think I'll only be using 3 out of the 8 items so I'm not happy about that, and right now I'm not so sure I want to keep on subscribing. I would probably advise on looking through instagram for future boxes to see if they improve prior to signing up. The total value came up to $21.48 using my estimates on the sample sizes and packets, and although it exceeds the $15 subscription cost, the items were all over the board and low quality that I would put the value much lower than what it is. I hate saying this, but I didn't adore this box and was hoping for more.</p>
