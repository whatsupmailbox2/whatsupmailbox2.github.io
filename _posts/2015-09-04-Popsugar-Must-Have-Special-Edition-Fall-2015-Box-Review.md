<p>Popsugar Special Edition boxes get shipped in non-marked brown boxes. This way no one knows that you have a $100 box at your front doorstep ;)</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to be receiving my Popsugar Special Edition box yesterday, I just had to open it up right away!</p>

<DD>Value $90</DD>

<p>Details on the necklace: "100% Cotton, Woven, Embroidered w/ Resin Beads, Brass Chain, Metallic Thread & 100% Cow Hide Backing"</p>

<p>Deepa Gurnani was founded by a husband and wife duo, both with Fashion and Design backgrounds. I love the design on this necklace, so blingy yet classy at the same time. Definitely a statement necklace!</p>

<p>This necklace is handmade in India so every piece is unique.</p>

</a></center>

<p>I love that this necklace came with a unique traditional Indian design jewelry pouch. I believe there are variations of the color and pattern. It's also quite big and roomy so you can use it for other types of storage too.</p>

<br>

<p>The necklace is really comfortable once it's on. This is due to the cow hide backing, it feels like a velvet type of material. It's soft and lays on your chest flat, so comfortable. It's also not very heavy (my neck says "thank you!").</p>

<p>I'm not sure I would have paid $90 for this beautiful necklace myself, but to be getting it in this box makes it a deal and much appreciated!</p>

<DD>Value $40</DD>

<p>I have some products by Becca but not this eye palette so this was a win for me! I tend to go more natural for my everyday look so I will surely be making good use of this palette. Plus it's made without Parabens, Sulfates or Phthalates, yay!</p>

<p>These shadows are infused with green coffee oil, which awakens the eyes and smooth the lids, while a built-in priming effect extends the wear of your shadow. It can also be used wet or dry as an eyeliner. I love using eyeshadows as eyeliner, it tends to last longer on my oily/combination skin versus using eye pencils alone.</p>

<p>These coasters match the Canvas Home platinum bowl that was in the Popsugar December 2014 box! They fit perfectly with my home decor and to be honest, I think they'll match any decor. Their handmade and hand-painted porcelain coasters that are glazed with platinum for that extra modern chic look. Love it!</p>

<p>Popsugar undervalued these! This tray is also available in Bloomingdales and you know they only carry quality stuff so that's a good sign ;) I love this tray, it's just like the coasters, so chic and modern! I've already put it on my work desk and set a diffuser and candle on top of it, so gorgeous!</p>

<p>"This creamy, water-activated enzyme powder effortlessly releases debris from skin, leaving it polished and baby soft in an instant. Optimally conditions skin to receive benefits of any treatment product used in conjunction with it. Functions as a 2-in-1 cleanser and toner for those not wearing makeup."</p>

<p>Exfoliators are a must in my beauty regimen. It keeps my skin smooth and radiant. Although I've never used a powder form of exfoliator before, I've read so many great reviews of this particular product that I can't wait to try it. The price is also not too steep in case I did like it and need to buy some more so that's a relief. I think this is a great item to include for fall, preps our skin for winter!</p>

<DD>Full Size 14 ml/0.5 fl.oz, Value $18</DD>

<p>This nail polish is big and oh so pretty, so different than any other nail polish I have, how unique! I love the color too, perfect for fall. It was featured in <a href="http://thezoereport.com/beauty/nails/fall-2015-nail-polish-trend-report/" target="_blank">The Zoe Report</a> as one of "Fall's Most Wearable Nail Color Trends".</p>

</a></center>

<p>Smith & Cult is a 5 Free nail polish and the color No Poem is a dark navy greyish color. It's very opaque and I found that 1 coat was more than adequate. The nail polish applicator is quite big due to the large size of the bottle itself, so application was somewhat weird for me at first but after 2 nails I got the hang of it. It's actually quite comfortable gripping it after awhile since there's curves and ridges for your fingers. With such a beautiful bottle and color, I'm totally going to buy more!</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This box was so beautiful and elegant, I'm glad I splurged and purchased it. Definitely items I would have purchased on my own and the total value was also amazing, triple the cost! Every item was gorgeous in its own way and I love the theme of white that was incorporated here, so modern and chic. Another great special edition box by <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">Popsugar</a>, yay!</p>
