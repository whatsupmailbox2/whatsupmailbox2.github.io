<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxNov2015BrandonBlackwoodClutch.jpg"></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Brandon Blackwood</b> Mini Leather Pouch</DT>
<DD>Value $265</DD>
</DL>

<p>This pouch/clutch is made of ethically sourced genuine vegetable tanned cowhide leather.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxNov2015BrandonBlackwoodClutch2.jpg"></center>

<p>It features silver filled hardware and lined with premium cotton.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxNov2015BrandonBlackwoodClutch3.jpg"></center>

<p>It has credit card/ID slots and a snap closure inside for change or other small items.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxNov2015BrandonBlackwoodClutch4.jpg"></center>

<p>It also has a leather keyring that is attached inside. You can either keep it inside, or display it outside of the clutch since you can pop it out of the bag as it fits through a small opening even even when the pouch is zipped closed.</p>

<p>When the spoilers came out for this item, I was like, yeah... ok... doesn't look like anything special. But after feeling the quality of the leather, the neat compartments inside plus the keyring, I think this is a pretty neat and gorgeous clutch!</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxNov2015JulesSmithNecklace.jpg"></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Jules Smith</b> Ari Lariat Necklace</DT>
<DD>Value $45</DD>
</DL>

<p>This silver necklace is interesting to say the least. It's long with elongated pave pendants, and the strands are adjustable so it allows you to choose the length of the pendant drop.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxNov2015JulesSmithNecklace2.jpg"></center>
<figcaption>A closer look at the pendant</figcaption>

<br>

<p>Although I do love pave necklaces, the lariat style just isn't for me. Plus I'm more of a gold person, so sadly this will be gifted.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Mary Jurek</b> Fidelia Square Bowl</DT>
<DD>Value $50</DD>
</DL>

<p>What a great item to receive for the upcoming holidays. I love beautiful serving pieces and this is just that. It's simple yet oozes luxury with its shiny silver finish. Just gorgeous.</p>
<br>

<figcaption>A look at the bowl from above</figcaption>

<br>

<p>You can see the square shape from above more clearly. This bowl actually comes in 4 different sizes, the one subscribers received is the 5" bowl. Knowing that, I may want to purchase the other sizes. Who am I kidding, I NEED to purchase the other sizes, pronto!</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxNov2015MaryJurekHolidayHeart.jpg"></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Mary Jurek</b> Holiday Heart Ornament</DT>
<DD>Value $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>Subscribers received either this Heart design, a 6-point Star or a Dove. I'm sooo thankful I got the Heart, it makes it more versatile as I can use this not just for the Christmas holidays, but Valentines, Birthdays, pretty much anything, yay!</p>

<p>And not only is it a beautiful and quality ornament, it also comes with its own silk string and micro-suede pouch, how thoughtful!</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxNov2015PaintedEarth.jpg"></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Painted Earth</b> Vitamin C Eye Treatment</DT>
<DD>Value $32.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>This Vitamin C enriched eye gel will reduce puffiness, sagging skin, under eye circles, wrinkles and crow's feet. It's oil-free, easy to apply and will help soothe and refresh the area around your eyes.</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT><b>Painted Earth</b> Optimum 15% Vitamin C Face Wash</DT>
<DD>Value $27</DD>
</DL>

<p>I always love a good face wash so I was happy to see this item in the box and I especially appreciate the pump dispenser, makes it so convenient to use and dispense on my Clarisonic brush.</p>

<p>This face wash will help reduce your sun spots and discoloration, as well as refine skin texture and reduce wrinkles. It's sulfate-free and gentle enough to use daily, but just be sure to put on sunscreen during the day if you use this. Any product that reduces sun spots or discoloration, if used during the day should be accompanied with sunscreen or else your spots will just get darker, and we sure don't want that.</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Luxor Box is in my good list again after a <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Luxor-Box-Subscription-September-2015-Review/" target="_blank">somewhat disappointing box in September</a>. I loved that they included an ornament, very fitting for the holidays. And the hero item for me was without a doubt the Brandon Blackwood pouch/clutch, just stunning and oh-so useful. The only miss was the necklace, but thankfully the value for that wasn't too high, and even more thankfully it wasn't the big ticket item either. So so happy with everything else. Even with the miss, I think this is probably my favorite box as of yet. Hurray Luxor Box, you've won my heart again. Here's to hoping January's box will be even better (fingers crossed).</p>
