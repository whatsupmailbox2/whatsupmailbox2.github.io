<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="http://shop.abeautifulmess.com/happy-mail" target="_blank">Happy Mail by A Beautiful Mess</a> is a monthly stationery subscription!</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $15/month (12-month commitment), OR $18/month (6-month commitment), OR $20/month (month to month) + Free Shipping</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> Each month, subscribers will receive $50 (retail value) of stationery at their doorstep. Most of it are greeting cards, but it will also include a couple of fun pieces like note pads, journals or stickers!</p>
<br>

<p>I've been wanting to try out this subscription for awhile and finally jumped the gun when they had a GWP promo: Get a FREE 2016 #PLAN Spiral Planner when you start a 6 or 12-month Happy Mail subscription.</p>

<br>

<p>Because my first package included this GWP, they sent my items out in a box to accomodate the planner. Happy Mail is typically sent with just the envelope packaging as below:</p>

</a></center>

<p>This is a thick paper envelope and it's shipped through UPS Ground. It took 6 days for it to arrive to me in Los Angeles.</p>

<br>

<p>Here's a look at the back of the packaging:</p>

<p>This month's package included a wooden "Happy Mail" stamp! I love stamps and this one is totally adorbs and can be used for pretty much any type of mail. I'll be using this frequently!</p>

<p>Birthday cards are always in need and these cards are simple yet chic at the same time.</p>

</a></center>

<p>Each of these cards have words on them. Starting from the left, the light bulb card has the word "our love is electric", the flower card in the middle has the word "my bad." on the back of it, and the right clothes hanger card has the word "Let's Hang Out" inside. All very cute and useful!</p>

<p>Heart stickers are great because you can use this for just about anything. Planners, gifts, mail, scrapbooking and more. Great addition especially for February.</p>

<br>

<p>Now on to the GWP:</p>

<p>I absolutely loved this planner, it's gorgeous and oh-so useful. So glad I got it as a GWP! FYI, these planners are limited edition.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I really enjoyed my first package from them especially since I also received a GWP! The planner is oh-so chic with its white and gold color, plus all the pages inside are very useful and there's 2 sheets of stickers inside as well, very well done. For the Happy Mail package itself, all the greeting cards were of high quality and the designs are totally usable for me. I especially loved this month's inclusion of a wooden stamp, I can forsee that being used quite frequently. With so many cards plus the stamp, the value for me personally is way above the $15 cost, so that was a win. I've committed to a 12-month subscription and I can honestly say that I'm happy I did so. I'll have a good collection of stationery now and won't need to rush to the store for a last minute greeting card situation that I tend to find myself in quite often. So happy I subscribed to this!</p>
